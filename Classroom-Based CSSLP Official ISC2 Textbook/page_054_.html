                                    software engineering must also be inspected. For example, software documentation
                                    includes installation procedures, error messages, and release notes.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Software defects must be tracked and addressed. Security defects
                                    have a life cycle. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a published

                                    when addressing data privacy. Software verification and validation (V&amp;V)
                                    evaluates how well the software is meeting its technical requirements and its
