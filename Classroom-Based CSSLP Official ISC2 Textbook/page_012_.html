                                    overarching level there is a security plan referred to as the System Security Plan
                                    (SSP). Simply put, the SSP formally documents the protection of a system. There are
                                    also lower-level, securityrelevant documents to be considered during each phase of

                                    development and the organizational development process. One security practitioner
                                    might perform a task completely different from one another, given the same business

                                    approach using guidelines while ensuring consistent results by leveraging
                                    procedures. Policies ensure that security team members and the business at large are

                                    <li><em>Requirements phase. </em>During this phase, software security documentation
                                        could include the documentation for functional and nonfunctional security
                                        requirements and misuse/abuse cases, or any subject-object matrix used to
                                        generate the misuse/abuse cases. Misuse/abuse cases will be discussed in detail
                                        in future domains.</li>
                                    <li><em>Design phase. </em>During this phase, software security documentation could
                                        include the documentation of the threat model. As part of creating a threat
                                        model, additional documentation is produced, including the most common usage
                                        scenarios, various user roles, dependencies, assumptions, and threat scenarios.
                                        This documentation can be useful for those who perform code reviews, and for
                                        those who create security test cases, among other possible uses in subsequent
                                        phases of the life cycle. Threat modeling will be discussed in detail in future
                                        domains.</li>
                                    <li><em>Implementation, testing, and subsequent life cycle phases. </em>During these
                                        phases, similar documentation should be expected. The simplest way to relate to
                                        these documentation needs is to consider the security activities in each phase.
                                        Some examples of security-relevant activities related to the implementation,
                                        testing, deployment, operations, and maintenance of software that may require

                                    leveraging standards to inform business operations. Security-centric documentation,
                                    including software security, follows the same conventions. Sofware security policies
                                    describe the objectives and constraints for organizational software security.
                                    Software policies are high level and provide the “what” and “why,” while procedures
                                    deal step-by-step with the “how.” Software security policies are normally technology
                                    independent.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">For example, an organizational software security policy might
                                    dictate that all software development efforts must include software assurance
                                    activities to ensure new code is relatively free from defects prior to being
                                    committed to the organization’s repository. The organization could have procedures
                                    that provide more task-specific support for software assurance policy goals. These
                                    procedures could describe the steps to execute static and dynamic analysis within
                                    the organization. The procedures for static and dynamic analysis might be based on
                                    organizational tools and guided by industry standards to describe defects such as
                                    MITRE CWE. If software assurance efforts were automated via gated check-in for the
                                    organizations DevSecOps pipeline, an alternative supporting procedure might describe
                                    the steps to update the analysis configuration files for the gated check-in instead.

                                    strategic enterprise level with policy. Policies will inform the standards to
                                    inherit, as well as which procedures must be created to ensure the organization’s
                                    operational and development security. Not every aspect of an organization can or
                                    should be described step-by-step. Security guidelines can help bridge the gap
                                    between strategic policy goals and the direct tasking offered by procedures. When
                                    higher-level documentation such as policies change, it also drives change to
                                    lower-level procedures.</p>
