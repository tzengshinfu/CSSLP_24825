                                    integrity, and availability of the systems and software throughout the life cycle.
                                    One consideration for maintaining the continuity of operations for systems includes
                                    the useful life of all subcomponents, especially when a system is designed to last
                                    an extended period. One way to reduce the risk of subcomponent replacement within
                                    the system life cycle is to embrace modular components. Modular or reusable security
                                    components can also reduce the overall financial impact of implementing secure
                                    system designs—especially with authentication and authorization.</p>

                                        default administrative account lists, automated brute force, and dictionary

                                    authentication-related cookie determines whether the user has already been
                                    authenticated or not. If no authentication-related cookie exists, one must be
                                    generated. If one exists, the subject will be redirected back to the resource it was
                                    originally trying to access.</p>

                                    multiple business partners allow a subject to undergo authentication and/or
                                    authorization in one security domain, and subsequently to access resources in others
                                    without the need for reauthentication. The concept has existed for many years, and
                                    has been implemented using different approaches and technologies, including Security
                                    Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and OAuth, depending on the objectives. SAML and
                                    OAuth have different workflows, hence one may be better suited than the other for a
                                    given scenario.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">SAML is used for both authentication and authorization between
                                    two parties. There are two primary types of providers: a service provider (e.g.,
                                    Office365) and an identity provider (e.g., Active Directory). The Service Provider
                                    (SP) agrees to trust the Identity Provider (IdP) in the authentication process. This
                                    is done through a SAML XML document sent by the IdP containing the user
                                    authorization and authentication and then redirected to the service provider.
                                    Relying on XML for transport, addressing security may require signing and encrypting
                                    SAML requests.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">OAuth2 is an open standard used for authorization. OAuth only
                                    authorizes devices, API, servers with access tokens rather than credentials, and it
                                    works over HTTPS. Unlike SAML, OAuth does not use XML, and may rely on JSON for
                                    transport. OAuth addresses some deficiencies of SAML in certain areas (e.g., mobile
                                    platforms).</p>

                                    Authorization refers to rights and privileges granted to an individual or process
                                    that enable access to computer resources and information assets.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Simply put, authorization is the process where requests to
                                    access a particular resource should be granted or denied. Authorization includes the
                                    execution rules that determine what functionality and data the user (or Principal)
                                    may access, ensuring the proper allocation of access rights after authentication is
                                    successful.<sup>9</sup></p>
                                <p class="comment78305">When designing authorization within the software, it is
                                    important to ensure the rights and privileges of the subject are checked before
                                    access is granted to the objects. Access control can be designed using different
                                    models. The three primary access control models are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Discretionary access control (DAC). </em>This model leaves an amount of
                                        access control to the discretion of the object’s owner or anyone else who is
                                        authorized to control the object’s access.</li>
                                    <li><em>Nondiscretionary access control (NDAC). </em>As the name implies, policies
                                        in this category have rules that are not established at the discretion of the
                                        user.</li>
                                    <li><em>Mandatory access control (MAC). </em>In this model, access control policy
                                        decisions are made by a central authority, not by the individual owner of an
                                        object, and the owner cannot change access rights.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="comment78305">Additionally, access control can be role-based (RBAC) or
                                    designed using the resource itself.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">As described by OWASP in its “Cheat Sheet Series:”</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">“In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), access decisions are based
                                    on an individual’s roles and responsibilities within the organization or user base.
                                </p>
                                <p class="comment78305">“The process of defining roles is usually based on analyzing the
                                    fundamental goals and structure of an organization and is usually linked to the
                                    security policy. For instance, in a medical organization, the different roles of
                                    users may include those such as a doctor, nurse, attendant, patient, etc. Obviously,
                                    these members require different levels of access to perform their functions, but
                                    also the types of web transactions and their allowed context vary greatly depending
                                    on the security policy and any relevant regulations (HIPAA, Gramm-Leach-Bliley,
                                    etc.).” </p>

                                        user ID and password. They can come in different forms such as a smartcard or a
                                        certificate.</li>
                                    <li><em>Credential Management API (Windows). </em>Developers who write for Microsoft
                                        Windows can use the Credential Management application programming interface
                                        (API), including Credential Management User Interface (UI) functions, to obtain
                                        and manage credential information such as usernames and passwords. These
                                        functions request Windows account information to be used in place of the
                                        credentials established while logging on. Such requests typically occur when the
                                        logon credentials do not have permissions required by the application. The
                                        Credential Management UI functions provide interfaces with the look and feel of
                                        the Windows UI. These functions include customizable options that add a user’s
                                        information to the user’s credentials store. </li>

                                <p class="comment78305">A good credential management system should be flexible enough to
                                    accommodate both internal and external access, differentiate roles and privileges,
                                    and implement software security mechanisms for access control. Attacks directed
                                    toward credential management systems will typically attempt to compromise a
                                    credential that can be used in a privilege escalation attack. If detected, a process
                                    must be in place to reissue credentials, which can be both expensive and
                                    time-consuming. Security awareness training and setting appropriate management
                                    expectations can go a long way toward preventing such attacks in the first place.

                                    interconnectivity design consideration. While the benefit of SSO is that it
                                    simplifies user authentication across multiple applications (i.e., it requires the
                                    user to log in only once and then be able to access applications or resources
                                    downstream), it requires careful thought and consideration because it often
                                    contradicts the complete mediation design principle. SSO is often implemented using
                                    tokens that are created upon successful authentication and then passed around
                                    between applications.</p>

                                    algorithms, the message is encrypted using the public key of the message recipient,

                                    processes on two systems that may or may not be trusted poses security challenges.
                                    Several security issues are related to information flow. Sensitive information
                                    (e.g., bank account information, health information, Social Security numbers, credit
                                    card statements) stored in a particular Web application should not be displayed on a
                                    client browser to those who are not authorized to view that information. Protection
                                    against malware such as spyware and Trojans means that network traffic that carries
                                    malicious payload is not allowed to enter the network. By controlling the flow of
                                    information or data, several threats to software can be mitigated and delivery of
                                    valid messages guaranteed. The enforcement of security policies concerning the flow
                                    of information to and from an application that is independent of code-level security
                                    protection mechanisms can be useful in implementing security protection when the
                                    code itself cannot be trusted. Firewalls, proxies, and middleware components such as
                                    queuing infrastructure and technologies can be used to control the rate of data
                                    transmission and allow or disallow the flow of information across trust boundaries.

                                    traffic between networks and hosts. As such, they enable organizations to delineate
                                    security zones supporting various security postures in each zone. Firewalls are
                                    commonly used to protect the internal trusted network from the outside, or control
                                    connectivity to specific areas, and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive systems
                                    and resources (e.g., production systems in the cloud). Firewalls may be network
                                    based or host based. Web application firewalls (WAFs) can provide a layer of
                                    protection for websites against common types of attacks including SQL injection and
                                    cross-site scripting (XSS).</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">For example, many enterprise networks employ firewalls to
                                    restrict connectivity to and from the internal networks used to service more
                                    sensitive functions, such as accounting or personnel. By employing firewalls to
                                    control connectivity to these areas, an organization can prevent unauthorized access
                                    to its systems and resources. Inclusion of a proper firewall provides an additional
                                    layer of security. Organizations often need to use firewalls to meet security
                                    requirements from mandates (e.g., FISMA); some mandates, such as the Payment Card
                                    Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), specifically require
                                    firewalling.<sup>11</sup></p>

                                    guidelines that regulate the following characteristics of a network: access method,
                                    allowed physical topologies, types of cabling, and speed of data transfer. These are

                                    received, and thousands of files are downloaded, saved, or transferred via various
                                    channels or devices daily. Enterprises routinely store and transmit sensitive data
                                    that customers, business partners, regulators, and shareholders expect them to
                                    protect. Unfortunately, companies constantly fall victim to massive data loss, and
                                    high-profile data leakage involving sensitive personal and corporate data continue.
                                    Data loss could harm a company’s competitiveness and reputation and could also
                                    invite compliance or reputational risks. Therefore, organizations should take
                                    measures to understand the sensitive data they hold, how it is controlled, and how
                                    to prevent data leaks.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">To properly safeguard sensitive data, organizations must develop
                                    or adopt a classification system for data (e.g., unclassified, confidential, secret,
                                    top secret) and label all data first. Each classification level should be protected
                                    to a level commensurate with classification (i.e., data labeled top secret should be
                                    safeguarded to higher levels than confidential data). In addition, metrics and
                                    policies should be created with respect to data creation, storage, transmission, and
                                    disposal. Organizations can implement technical controls, which are often referred

                                    also on the host, taking advantage of the resource abstraction capabilities provided
                                    by the hypervisor to dynamically utilize resources from the host as needed. Hardware

                                    hyperjacking, which involves installing a rogue hypervisor that can take complete
                                    control of a host. This may be accomplished through the use of a VM-based rootkit
                                    that attacks the original hypervisor, inserting a modified rogue hypervisor in its

                                    hypervisor that provides hardware-level isolation of resources across VMs. Each VM
                                    sees its own virtual hardware and includes a complete guest OS in addition to the

                                    to them. Containers are OS-family specific; a Linux host can only run containers
                                    built for Linux, and a Windows host can only run Windows containers. Also, a
                                    container built for one OS family should run on any recent OS from that

                                    <li><em>Encryption. </em>Various precautions can be taken to secure databases. One
                                        possibility is to encrypt sensitive data in the database and find mechanisms to
                                        protect the encryption key. This can help mitigate the risk of unauthorized
                                        disclosure for subjects without the knowledge of the key. Many database
                                        management systems (DBMSs) support encryption. It is recommended that software
                                        development teams familiarize themselves with the encryption capabilities of
                                        their DBMS. In practice, the encryption solution required to achieve the
                                        specific security objectives may be as simple as using the capabilities offered
                                        by the DBMS or involve more complex solutions. For example, real-time I/O
                                        encryption and decryption of the data and log files may be achieved through
                                        Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), which may or may not be sufficient depending
                                        on specifics of the requirements.<br />Note that for compliance with certain
                                        standards, FIPS 140-2-compliant cryptographic services modules/providers may
                                        have to be used.</li>
                                    <li><em>Triggers. </em>A database trigger is a reference to a special type of
                                        procedure that automatically executes in response to the occurrence of an event.
                                        These events include INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, CREATE, or even DROP among other
                                        data manipulations or data definition events. Triggers can be useful for logging
                                        events of special interest.</li>
                                    <li><em>Views. </em>A database view can be thought of as a dynamic table—one that
                                        can exclude certain columns from a table or one that spans multiple tables. This
                                        can be valuable from a security perspective. When views are created, they may be
                                        constructed in such a way that they will obscure the schema, which also is
                                        valuable from a security perspective. The view is a way of portraying
                                        information in the database. The best view for a particular purpose depends on
                                        the information the user needs.<br />The view can be created by arranging the
                                        data items in a specific order, highlighting certain items, or showing only
                                        certain items. For any database, there are a number of possible views that may
                                        be specified. Databases with many items tend to have more possible views than
                                        databases with few items. Often thought of as a virtual table, the view doesn’t
                                        actually store information but rather pulls it out of one or more existing
                                        tables. Although impermanent, a view may be accessed repeatedly by storing its
                                        criteria in a query. As well as being a security mechanism, the view can also be
                                        used to hide complexity and support legacy code.</li>
                                    <li><em>Privilege management. </em>Every database user needs certain privileges to
                                        do their job. Granting appropriate privileges to appropriate users is the major
                                        task in privilege management. Privilege is the key to unlock database access, so
                                        managing privileges and roles is a vital responsibility of database
                                        administrators. The administrator also needs to manage privileges for a user
                                        role. The role is a named group of related privileges that is granted to users
                                        or other roles. For databases with multiple users where many require a similar
                                        set of access level, it is beneficial to use roles.</li>

                                <p class="comment78305">There are many programming languages. Some are functional like R
                                    for statistics, and some are object-oriented such as C#, which is popular for .NET
                                    framework development tasks. Some are high-level and like scripting— Python for
                                    example—while others are low level such as Embedded C and used for developing
                                    firmware. Abstracted from language, framework, and business use case considerations,
                                    all software development efforts require environments for writing, running, testing,
                                    and maintaining source code. Considerations often include compilers, linkers,
                                    packagers, debuggers, emulators, and many other productivity tools for software
                                    developers. The combination of modern development tools into a unified development
                                    environment is referred to as an integrated development environment (IDE).</p>

                                    operating system, may drive language and IDE requirements. Some languages use an
                                    intermediary runtime environment such as Java JVM and .NET Core. Using these
                                    frameworks allows developers to write source and deploy to multiple hosting
                                    operating systems. The intermediary runtime handles compatibility across platforms.

                                    system it is running on. In addition, unlike the old principal-based security, the
                                    CLR enforces security policy based on where code is coming from rather than who the
                                    user is. This model, called code access security, makes sense in today’s environment
                                    because so much code is installed over the internet and even a trusted user doesn’t
                                    know when that code is safe.</p>

                                    framework and is responsible for managing the execution of .NET programs. In a
                                    process known as just-in-time (JIT) compilation, the compiled code is converted into
                                    machine instructions that, in turn, are executed by the computer’s CPU. The CLR
                                    provides additional services including memory management, type safety and exception
                                    handling. All programs written for the .NET framework, regardless of programming
                                    language, are executed by the CLR. It provides exception handling, garbage
                                    collection, and thread management. CLR is common to all versions of the .NET

                                    JVM converts Java byte code into machine language and executes it. The JRE is both a
                                    standalone and a web browser plug-in; the latter allows Java applets to run within a
                                    browser. Without the JRE, Java programs and applets cannot be executed.<sup>15</sup>

                                    certain types of software developed today, it is important to understand that
                                    interrupts are essential facilities that may be used to signal that an event needs
                                    attention, allowing the operating system to take an action in response to the
                                    occurrence of that event.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">An example is using the interrupts to signal to the processor
                                    that a key has been pressed on the keyboard. Using this mechanism, one could
                                    understand that this would be analogous to “Tap me on the shoulder to get my
                                    attention” when some event occurs. This could certainly present a performance
                                    advantage over constant polling of a device regarding the occurrence of some event.
