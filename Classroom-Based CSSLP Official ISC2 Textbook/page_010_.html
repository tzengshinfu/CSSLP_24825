                                        of the Level 1 profile benchmark is to lower the attack surface of your
                                        organization while keeping machines usable and not hindering business

                                        the Level 2 profile can have an adverse effect on an organization if not
                                        implemented appropriately or without due care.<sup>1</sup></li>

                                    used, testing should be conducted to determine potential impacts before implementing

                                    an initiative from the U.S. government for automation and standardization of
                                    vulnerability management, and it has gained widespread support through major vendors

                                            class="rendered">vulnerability</button> </strong>assessment/management. One
                                    can think of SCAP as a way of automating STIG checking. As mentioned earlier, there
                                    are hundreds of STIGs. Each contains many findings. For example, Windows Server 2022
                                    version 1 has 30 Category I, 233 Category II, and 12 Category III findings. It would
                                    not be feasible for security practitioners to check all STIG guidance for all
                                    applications and operating systems in an enterprise without the help of automation.
                                    The Red Hat community produces a STIG automation tool called OpenSCAP that also
                                    supports STIG checking.</p>

                                    development within software security standards. Although SWID are not widely
                                    adopted, some organizations leverage the technology to record unique information
                                    about software applications and metadata, including name and version. SWID could aid
                                    next-generation IT configuration management software in providing consistent

                                    How the configurations are established and maintained requires a disciplined

                                <p class="comment78305">Using secure CM practices, organizations ensure that changes are
                                    formally identified, proposed, reviewed, analyzed for security impact, tested, and
                                    approved prior to implementation. As part of the configuration change control
                                    effort, organizations can employ a variety of access restrictions for change
                                    including access controls, process automation, abstract layers, change windows, and
