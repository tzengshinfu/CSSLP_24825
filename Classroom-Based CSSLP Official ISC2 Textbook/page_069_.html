                                    ensuring that neither the security nor integrity of developed applications is
                                    compromised during deployment. The Secure Deployment (SD) practice focuses on this.
                                    To this end, the practice’s first stream focuses on removing manual error by
                                    automating the deployment process as much as possible and making its success
                                    contingent upon the outcomes of integrated security verification checks. It also
                                    fosters separation of duties by making adequately trained non-developers responsible
                                    for deployment.<sup>2</sup></p>

                                <p class="comment78305">DevOps requires tasks such as builds, testing, and deployment to
                                    occur frequently and naturally. For that to happen, such tasks must be automated.
                                    Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) practice relies on the automation
                                    of much of the routine work of transforming code changes into working software,
                                    including delivering tested code into production.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Continuous integration is a reference to the build and test
                                    cycle. Continuous integration (CI) servers build the project from scratch when
                                    developers merge their changes into a shared version control repository. Continuous
                                    delivery (CD) is a reference to the code movement from one environment to another
                                    (e.g., dev to QA to UAT). CI and CD typically go hand in hand, and the same CI
                                    server will likely also handle CD.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Traced back to build servers like Hudson, Jenkins, and Microsoft
                                    Team Foundation Server, CI/CD has become a collection of technologies and practices
                                    that support the mission of releasing new code changes while keeping things stable.
                                </p>
                                <p class="comment78305">In practice, CI/CD would rely on a system to trigger the process
                                    of compilation and run all tests and checks that have been automated.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Clearly, inconsistent methods, lack of automation and
                                    integration of security testing tools, and excessive false positives can contribute
                                    to the application security challenges in CI/CD workflows.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">A distinction between continuous delivery and continuous
                                    deployment must be made. Whereas continuous integration (CI) is part of both
                                    continuous delivery and continuous deployment (the step that involves deployment to
                                    production is manual in the case of continuous delivery), continuous deployment goes
                                    one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that
                                    passes all stages of the production pipeline is released to customers with no human
                                    intervention, and only a failed test will keep a new change from being deployed to
                                    production. </p>

                                    pipeline is challenging. Hooks for pre-commit checks, commit-time checks, build-time
                                    checks, test-time checks, and deploy-time checks may all be needed. For example:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Using IDE security plugins to run scans before code is checked into the shared
                                        repository.</li>
                                    <li>Performing static code analysis with limited rulesets (e.g., top three
                                        vulnerabilities) to provide developers with quick feedback upon committing
                                        changes to the repository.</li>
                                    <li>Running even more in-depth security checks (e.g., OWASP Top 10), and software
                                        composition analysis of open-source components at build time.</li>
                                    <li>Performing dynamic analysis or fuzzing.</li>

                                    ecosystem.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">iOS only allows apps that it considers safe. First, it must
                                    verify the source of the app and its integrity. The only executable code that iOS
                                    will allow apps to run must be signed with an Apple-issued certificate. This is true
                                    regardless of whether the app came with the device or is a third-party app. This
                                    certificate validates the iOS app developers’ identity and tells iOS that they are
                                    known to and verified by Apple. iOS developers are required to join the Apple
                                    Developer Program. iOS apps are also reviewed to ensure adherence to certain
                                    requirements for operations and bugs.</p>

                                <p class="comment78305">Android was designed to be open, with an eye toward creating a
                                    developer-friendly platform. Securing an open and developer-oriented platform
                                    involves various layers of security and a strong security architecture.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">For starters, although some developers are security experts,
                                    some are not. Android’s approach was to cater to both types of developers, offering
                                    flexible controls to the security-savvy and protecting the not-so-savvy through
                                    secure defaults and built-in controls. Android relies on mechanisms to protect
                                    against hacks and corruption through a chain of trust. For example, during the
                                    verified boot process, each stage ensures the integrity and authenticity of the next
                                    stage, before execution gets handed over.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Like iOS, Android sandboxes its apps. This keeps apps separate
                                    from each other and protects apps and the system from misbehaving and malicious
                                    apps. Android also has a read-only system partition that contains the kernel, OS
                                    libraries, application runtime, platform apps, and other features. This partition
                                    protects the most crucial parts of the operating system from malicious apps, as well
                                    as from users who might accidentally delete or change a vital part of the OS.</p>

                                    signed applications to users, including software developed by third parties.
                                    Different platforms perform code signing in different ways, but in most cases,
                                    application stores are operated by the OS or platform vendor to distribute only
                                    those applications that have undergone some level of vetting based on a defined
                                    policy. While individual developers may have their own signing keys, either for
                                    development purposes or to authenticate to the store, the private keys used to sign
                                    applications are under the control of the store, which serves as the Code Signing
                                    System (CSS). Developers submit their applications to the store, and their
                                    identities are verified before the apps undergo vetting. If everything is in order,
                                    the store signs the app and publishes it, making it available for download. Devices
                                    can be configured to only install apps that have been signed by a key controlled by
                                    the application store.<sup>6</sup></p>
