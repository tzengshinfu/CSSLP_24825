                                <p class="comment78305">The <strong>data classification </strong>process requires a
                                    consistent approach to categorizing data based on criteria that are well thought
                                    out, specific, and predefined. The classification of data helps determine what
                                    baseline security controls are appropriate for safeguarding that data, which in turn
                                    can help ensure data protection is done in the most cost-effective manner.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The classification process relies on the assumption that the
                                    organization has a clear understanding of the data it has in its possession,
                                    regardless of data format, and structured or unstructured. This may require the
                                    organization to perform a discovery exercise to develop this understanding and
                                    establish an inventory of data assets.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The modern enterprise has evolved into a giant producer and
                                    consumer of data. Despite the large volume of controls and efforts to protect
                                    various data types, few organizations can map exactly where their sensitive data is
                                    located and what security controls are deployed to guard it.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Where data is dispersed, this can increase the risks and
                                    potential vulnerabilities associated with data storage and management. For
                                    organizations to adequately mitigate these risks, they should first locate data
                                    types to understand and map where data resides, along with the type and content of
                                    the data. This step is called data discovery.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Classification is the next step after data discovery.
                                    Classification implies that data will be identified and understood according to
                                    sensitivity, value, usefulness, age, or any other relevant criteria as determined by
                                    the organization or by the applicable laws and regulations.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Proper data classification is essential to build effective data
                                    controls, thus enabling compliance with relevant laws, regulations and standards,
                                    and internal security policy.</p>

                                    classification. After classification, labeling and marking must be applied.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">For each sensitivity classification, different handling
                                    requirements and procedures must be specified pertaining to the access, usage, and
                                    destruction of the data. For example, in a corporation, confidential information may
                                    only be accessed by senior management and a select few people throughout the
                                    company. To access the information, two or more may be required to enter their
                                    access codes, the auditing can be detailed and monitored daily, and paper copies of

                                <p class="comment78305">Secure data labeling and marking involves several different
                                    aspects, including security policy, security classification, and data sensitivity.
                                    The terms “security markings” and “security labels” are defined in NIST publications
                                    as follows:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Security labels. </em>This is the means used to associate a set of security
                                        attributes with a specific information object as part of the data structure for
                                        that object.</li>
                                    <li><em>Security markings. </em>This is the means used to associate a set of
                                        security attributes with objects in a human-readable form that enables
                                        organizational process-based enforcement of information security policies.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="comment78305">To distinguish between these two terms, think of marking hard
                                    copies with the classifications, while labeling objects in IT systems.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Classifications are fundamental to many security services. For
                                    example, data loss prevention systems may use classifications; intrusion detection
                                    systems may use classifications; database management systems may associate
                                    classifications with fields, records, tables, or other entities; and operating
                                    systems may associate classifications with processes and users.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Labeling systems can help assess the sensitivity of the
                                    information involved, which in turn can help apply the degree of protection that is
                                    most appropriate for that type of information. Applying strong authentication,
                                    strong cryptographic protection, tamper detection mechanisms, and other controls is
                                    only valuable where such a level of protection is required. Ultimately, this can
                                    help organizations achieve cost-effective security measures.</p>

                                    based on the perceived impact of a breach in confidentiality, integrity, or

                                    their work-related tasks. They require the level of access to the data necessary for
                                    performing their duties and activities. Data users also have data security
                                    responsibilities: they must follow operational security procedures to ensure the
                                    confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.</p>

                                    difficult to process or analyze using conventional tools and methods. Modern NoSQL
                                    (or “not only SQL”) data management tools may be used to access and manipulate these

                                    confidentiality in a multilevel security (MLS) system. It defines two primary
                                    security constructs, subjects, and objects. Subjects are the active parties, while
                                    objects are the passive parties. To help determine what subjects will be allowed to
                                    do, they are assigned clearances that outline what modes of access (e.g., read,
                                    write) they can use when they interact with objects.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The model system uses labels to keep track of clearances and
                                    classifications and implements a set of rules to limit interactions between
                                    different types of subjects and objects. It was an early security model and does not
                                    provide a mechanism for a one-tone mapping of individual subjects and objects. This
                                    also needs to be addressed by other models or features within a practical operating
                                    system.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The model defines two properties, the ss-property and the
                                    *-property.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Simple security property. </em>A subject cannot read/access an object of a
                                        higher classification (no read up).</li>
                                    <li><em>Star property. </em>A subject can only save an object at the same or higher
                                        classification (no write down).</li>

                                <p class="comment78305">The model does not attempt to define technical constructs or
                                    solutions. It merely identifies a high-level set of rules that if implemented
                                    correctly, prevent the exposure or unauthorized disclosure of information in a
                                    system processing different classification levels of data.</p>

                                    given subject has access to objects with sensitive information associated with two
                                    competing parties. The principle is that users should not access the confidential
                                    information of both a client organization and one or more of its competitors. At the
                                    beginning, subjects may access either set of objects. However, once a subject
                                    accesses an object associated with one competitor, they are instantly prevented from
                                    accessing any objects on the opposite side. This is intended to prevent the subject
                                    from sharing information inappropriately between the two competitors even
                                    unintentionally. It is called the Chinese Wall Model because, like the Great Wall of
                                    China, once on one side of the wall, a person cannot get to the other side. It is an
                                    unusual model in comparison with many of the others because the access control rules
                                    change based on subject behavior.</p>

                                    not address data confidentiality. Like Bell-LaPadula, Biba is also a lattice-based
                                    model with multiple levels. It defines similar but slightly different modes of
                                    access (e.g., observe, modify) and also describes interactions between subjects and
                                    objects. Where Biba differs most obviously is that it is an integrity model; it
                                    focuses on ensuring that the integrity of information is being maintained by
                                    preventing corruption.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">At the core of the model is a multilevel approach to integrity
                                    designed to prevent unauthorized subjects from modifying objects. Access is
                                    controlled to ensure that objects maintain their current state of integrity as
                                    subjects interact with them. Instead of the confidentiality levels used by
                                    Bell-LaPadula, Biba assigns integrity levels to subjects and objects depending on
                                    how trustworthy they are considered to be. Like Bell-LaPadula, Biba considers the
                                    same modes of access but with different results.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The model defines three properties, the ss-property and the
                                    *-property as in BLP, but also includes a new property, the invocation property.</p>

                                <p class="comment78305">Biba only addresses one of three key integrity goals. The
                                    Clark-Wilson model improves Biba by focusing on integrity at the transaction level
                                    and addressing three major goals of integrity in a commercial environment. To
                                    address the second goal of integrity, Clark and Wilson realized that they needed a
                                    way to prevent authorized subjects from making undesirable changes. This required
                                    that transactions by authorized subjects be evaluated by another party before they
                                    were committed on the model system. This provides a separation of duties where the
                                    powers of the authorized subject were limited by another subject given the power to
                                    evaluate and complete the transaction.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">To address internal consistency (or consistency within the model
                                    system itself), Clark and Wilson recommended a strict definition of well-formed
                                    transactions. In other words, the set of steps within any transaction would need to
                                    be carefully designed and enforced. Any deviation from that expected path would
                                    result in a failure of the transaction to ensure that the model system’s integrity
                                    was not compromised. To control all subject and object interactions, Clark-Wilson
                                    establishes a system of subject–program–object bindings such that the subject no
                                    longer has direct access to the object. Instead, this is done through a program with
                                    access to the object. This program arbitrates all access and ensures that every
                                    interaction between subject and object follows a defined set of rules. The program
                                    provides for subject authentication and identification and limits all access to
                                    objects under its control.</p>

                                    objects are created, how subjects are assigned rights or privileges, and how
                                    ownership of objects is managed. In other words, it is primarily concerned with how
                                    a model system controls subjects and objects at a basic level where other models
                                    simply assumed such control.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The Graham-Denning access control model has three parts: a set
                                    of objects, a set of subjects, and a set of rights. The subjects are composed of two
                                    things: a process and a domain. The domain is the set of constraints controlling how
                                    subjects may access objects. Subjects may also be objects at specific times. The set
                                    of rights govern how subjects may manipulate passive objects. This model describes
                                    eight primitive protection rights called commands that subjects can execute to have
                                    an effect on other subjects or objects.</p>
