                                    answering questions about protecting assets. Threat modeling’s application to
                                    software design has been gaining widespread adoption in recent years. During threat
                                    modeling exercises, security practitioners systematically identify and rate the
                                    threats that are most likely to affect business critical systems. Threats are
                                    prioritized by impact and component criticality and addressed accordingly.</p>

                                    energy, retail, etc.—recognize cyberthreats as a key area of concern. Malware and

                                    activities. The threat modeling process identifies threats that can do harm to the
                                    system; provides an estimate of potential harm; and identifies the need for security
                                    features, careful code review, and security testing. To do this, the CSSLP needs to

                                    types of malicious software such as ransomware. In addition, there are many other
                                    factors that could also have an adverse impact on the security objectives of
                                    confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Just a few examples are:</p>

                                    <li>Software reliability issues, such as a mobile messaging application that

                                    <li>Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, that adversely impact availability</li>
                                    <li>Circumstantial spikes on load and volume, such as the increase in the use of
                                        virtual communication services and infrastructure due to a pandemic that
                                        requires social distancing</li>

                                    and Common Knowledge (ATT&amp;CK) was introduced. It was pointed out that ATT&amp;CK
                                    was created out of a need to document adversary behaviors.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">ATT&amp;CK is largely a knowledge base of adversarial
                                    techniques—a breakdown and classification of offensively oriented actions that can
                                    be used against platforms such as Windows. Unlike prior work in this area, the focus
                                    isn’t on the tools and malware that adversaries use but on how they interact with
                                    systems during an operation.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">ATT&amp;CK organizes these techniques into a set of tactics to
                                    provide context for the technique. Each technique includes information that’s
                                    relevant to both a red team or penetration tester to understand how a technique
                                    works, and to a defender to understand the context surrounding events or artifacts
                                    generated by a technique in use.<sup>16</sup></p>

                                    <li><em>Viruses. </em>As conventionally defined, a virus has the ability to
                                        replicate itself (infect other files) and target binary executable files.
                                        Viruses may spread via the network or through infected removable media, among
                                        other possibilities. When the infected host file is executed, the virus is
                                        executed as well. An event (e.g., user interaction) will trigger the delivery of
                                        the payload. Some viruses are metamorphic—that is, they can evolve into variants
                                        by modifying themselves. Viruses come in many varieties. Depending on the
                                        particular virus, they may infect files, boot records, or other parts of the
                                        computer.</li>
                                    <li><em>Worms. </em>Also considered self-replicating, worms spread throughout a

                                    <li><em>Trojan. </em>This is a program designed for malicious activities that runs
                                        under the disguise of a legitimate/benign program. Trojans do not reproduce (in
                                        contrast to viruses and worms). The creation of backdoors is common with
                                        Trojans.</li>
                                    <li><em>Ransomware. </em>This is a type of malware that typically attempts to block
                                        access to files (e.g., through cryptographic means) for the purpose of extortion
                                        and ransom payment.</li>

                                        normally automate tasks and services. Bots may not be created for malicious
                                        activities, but malicious bots can become part of a remote command and control
                                        center for launching flooding (DoS) attacks. Botnets are an entire network of

                                    libraries will be discussed in later chapters. For now, recognize that third-party
                                    software always carries a security risk. When software is developed outside the
                                    organization’s control and without sufficient visibility into the development life
                                    cycle processes, there are risks that need to be addressed. This is true of
                                    purchased off-the-shelf software as well as custom software that has been developed
                                    through outsourcing/offshoring arrangements.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">To reduce the threat of third-party software, organizations
                                    should:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Remove all software that is not used/needed. This includes removing or disabling
                                        all software features that are unlikely to be used, ultimately reducing the
                                        attack surface. There are tools that can help with this task, but most
                                        organizations do not follow this path.</li>
                                    <li>Work with vendors that have proper and defined patch management release cycles
                                        and inform customers of discovered vulnerabilities and availability of updates
                                        to address them. Further, a third-party patch management solution should be
                                        implemented. This solution should provide assurance that third-party patches are
                                        frequently identified, tested, and applied subject to patch management cycles.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Develop a clear understanding of all libraries and components that make up the
                                        software developed by third-party vendors. This may partially be achieved by
                                        reviewing the licensing arrangement of the vendor. For assurance, a
                                        comprehensive list of libraries and components must be obtained from the vendor.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Maintain an inventory and list of authorized software in the organization and
                                        restrict the usage of unauthorized third-party software on corporate IT assets.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Reduce the attack surface by blocking ports and restricting connections and
                                        communications on the network and between hosts. This can be done by using web
                                        application firewall (WAF) functionality where appropriate in layered defenses.

                                    abstract representation of some domain of human experience, used (1) to structure
                                    knowledge, (2) to provide a common language for discussing that knowledge, and (3)

                                    modeling, including threat, threat actor, threat event, threat vector, threat
                                    scenario, campaign, attacker, attack, attack vector, attack activity, malicious
                                    cyber activity, and intrusion. Different threat modeling approaches define these
                                    terms differently, due to assumptions about the contexts and purposes for which they
                                    will be used. Terminology related to threat is embedded in a larger setting of
                                    terminology about risk.”<sup>18</sup></p>

                                    number of threats continues to grow. This being the case, threat modeling is a
                                    critical step in securing software against attacks. The process of threat modeling
                                    involves first identifying potential threats to the application, then ranking these
                                    threats by risk, and finally selecting appropriate countermeasures or mitigations
                                    for the threats.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Here are some guidelines for software threat modeling.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Select the threat modeling participants. </em>There are no preset rules as
                                        to who may or may not participate in a threat modeling exercise. Participating
                                        members may be security engineers, architects, developers, or other software
                                        stakeholders—even customers may be involved—as deemed appropriate by the
                                        organization and the project.</li>
                                    <li><em>Threat model early in the life cycle. </em>Although threat modeling can
                                        theoretically be performed during any stage of development, for its findings to
                                        inform and influence the design of the software, it would be best to conduct it
                                        as early as possible. As such, threat modeling may be considered a design phase
                                        security activity, ideally taking place as soon as the architecture is
                                        established. Keep in mind that identifying and remediating potential issues at
                                        later stages can be much more costly, if doing so is even possible at all.</li>
                                    <li><em>Determine what to threat model. </em>Organizations may threat model new
                                        applications or existing applications. They may choose to threat model an entire
                                        application or just specific components/modules of the application (e.g., the
                                        authentication module). It would be wise to start small, gain experience and do
                                        it successfully, and then increase the scope of the threat model.</li>
                                    <li><em>Document the threat model. </em>As part of creating a threat model,
                                        documentation is also produced. This documentation can be useful for those who
                                        perform code reviews, for those who create security test cases, and others.
                                        Simply put, the work that is accomplished and the documents produced as part of
                                        a threat modeling exercise will benefit activities in other phases of the data
                                        life cycle as well.</li>
                                    <li><em>Update the threat model. </em>The threat model should be reviewed and
                                        updated as required to reflect the changes in application design and

                                    the software community. The following are three of the most widely used ones.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Microsoft threat modeling tool. </em>Introduced in the late 2000s, the
                                        Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool makes threat modeling easier for all developers
                                        through a standard notation for visualizing system components, data flows, and
                                        security boundaries. It also helps threat modelers identify classes of threats
                                        they should consider based on the structure of their software design. We
                                        designed the tool with nonsecurity experts in mind, making threat modeling
                                        easier for all developers by providing clear guidance on creating and analyzing
                                        threat models.<sup>19</sup></li>
                                    <li><em>OWASP Threat Dragon. </em>Introduced in the late 2010s, it is a tool used to
                                        create threat model diagrams and to record possible threats and decide on their
                                        mitigations.<sup>20</sup></li>

                                    <li><em>Threatspec. </em>Threatspec is open source. Its main value can be attributed
                                        to helping to close the gap between development and security by bringing the
                                        threat modelling process further into the development process. This is achieved
                                        by having developers and security engineers write threat specifications
                                        alongside code, then dynamically generating reports and data-flow diagrams from
                                        the code. This allows engineers to capture the security context of the code they
                                        write, as they write it.<sup>21</sup></li>

                                    help create abstractions of the system being threat modeled, identify potential
                                    attackers and their goals and objectives, and promote an understanding of potential
                                    threats that may rise. Threat modeling methods and techniques vary in popularity and
                                    comprehensiveness, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. Different
                                    methodologies are better suited for certain purposes or types of systems. Sometimes,
                                    multiple methodologies can be used at once. A few methodologies follow.</p>

                                    in conjunction with STRIDE to suggest ranking threats on a scale of 1 to 10 based on
                                    predefined assessment criteria. This required estimating the negative impact that
                                    could result from an attack, attack frequency, effort to exploit, and expertise
                                    required to successfully execute the attack, which would produce a likelihood of
                                    exploitation. The DREAD criteria, score, and comments are listed here.

                                    contains seven steps, each with multiple activities aligned to business objectives
                                    and technical requirements. PASTA can also assist security practitioners with
                                    business analysis for identifying compliance gaps. The stages and activities of
                                    PASTA are listed in this table.</p>

                                    on a system. Attack trees should be simple and easily understood, but often
                                    construction requires a thorough understanding of system details and the security
                                    objectives, which may not be completely understood during diagramming. If attack
                                    trees can be constructed, the tree root is the goal for the attack, and the leaves
                                    are ways to achieve that goal. Each goal is represented as a separate tree. Thus,
                                    the system threat analysis produces a set of attack trees. When attack trees are
                                    built, they can be used to make security decisions, see if the systems are
                                    vulnerable to an attack, and evaluate a specific type of attack.<sup>23</sup></p>

                                        requirements model that ensures that each asset’s level of assigned risk is
                                        classified as acceptable by the system’s stakeholders.</li>
                                    <li><em>ATASM. </em>Architecture, Threats, Attack Surfaces, and Mitigations (ATASM)
                                        is a threat-modeling approach that highlights the importance of structural
                                        understanding of a system for the purpose of threat modeling (architecture).
                                    </li>
                                    <li><em>Threat Library/List Approach. </em>Using a predefined set of common and
                                        prevalent threats, a team can identify instances in the product by tracking the
                                        triggers. For example, cross-site scripting might be present if a product offers
                                        a web interface and no input validation and output sanitization. The team is
                                        free to evolve the threat library as technologies and frameworks change.</li>
                                    <li><em>Lightweight/Rapid Threat Modeling. </em>There are a range of processes that
                                        use lighter-weight variations of other methodologies, and additional approaches
                                        that use quick classifications and other ways to achieve a similar result in

                                    challenges and require the adoption of methods and processes that are better suited
                                    for such environments. For one thing, consider that threat modeling is an activity
                                    that primarily belongs to the design stage, and that in Agile implementations the
                                    design stage may not be as clearly defined as it normally would be with
                                    waterfall-like methodologies. This challenge has been clearly pointed out by
                                    SAFECode: “A pitfall may lie in trying to create threat models for each sprint and
                                    then trying to merge them to threat-model the entire system. At the beginning of a
                                    set of sprints, not enough is known to threat-model the whole system, because every
                                    sprint may affect the threat model.</p>

                                <p class="comment78305">Challenges for threat modeling in DevOps environments stem from
                                    frequency of software changes and absence of traditional change review/management
                                    processes, among other development characteristics.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">SAFECode notes, “As DevOps blurs the line between software
                                    changes and infrastructure changes, there are additional triggers for threat
                                    modeling that historically would have been covered by the infrastructure change
                                    management process. The two most prevalent additional triggers in DevOps are:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Alteration of the software deployment process. Most DevOps environments include
                                        tools that automatically build components based on activity in a source code
                                        repository, and then deploy those components to production. Compromising any
                                        portion of this process can lead to a full compromise of the service, so any
                                        change to the authentication/authorization, data flow and elements involved in
                                        the deployment automation warrants a threat model review.</li>
                                    <li>Changes to the executing environment of the services, including new
                                        ports/protocols, alterations to the application server or OS configuration,
                                        account and permissions alterations, etc. There are numerous resources
                                        describing what events should trigger a review during a change management
                                        process, and those triggers map equally well to threat modeling.”<sup>28</sup>

                                    analysis exercise is ultimately about reducing the attack surface of the software
                                    and hence the opportunity for software compromise, resulting in reduction of the
                                    risk. This objective requires a clear understanding of the attack surface of the
                                    software through proper analysis.</p>

                                    attack surface that has been created enables the identification of high-risk areas.
                                    Measuring the attack surface of the application and tracking changes to the attack
                                    surface over time is another part of the attack-surface analysis process mentioned
                                    earlier. Measurement of the attack surface over time may be accomplished through
                                    Relative Attack Surface Quotient (RASQ). Using this method, an overall attack
                                    surface score can be calculated. As changes are made to the system, this score
                                    should be remeasured. Clearly, it is desirable for the attack surface to shrink over
                                    time, but adding new code (i.e., providing additional functionality) will likely
                                    increase the attack surface.</p>

                                    can be used to incrementally identify and manage risks as changes are made to the
                                    application. Ask yourself the following questions: What has changed? What are you
                                    doing differently? What holes might you have opened?</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Typically, an application’s attack surface will increase over
                                    time as more interfaces are added, components age, users and roles are expanded, and
                                    unintended system integrations occur. The attack surface can be reduced by
                                    simplifying the model (reducing the number of user levels, for example, or not
                                    storing any unnecessary confidential data), turning off unused features and
                                    interfaces, and introducing operational controls, such as a software-based web

                                    catalogued to produce threat intelligence. For example, firewall logs may be used to
                                    identify IP addresses for malicious actors, or email systems may be used to
                                    determine attributes of phishing attacks. One main challenge with using
                                    organizations’ internal data for studying threats is the protection of sensitive
                                    information. Threat information should be gathered in accordance with regulatory,
                                    privacy, legal and security requirements. Special consideration may apply to threat
                                    information that is shared with other organizations.</p>

                                    knowledge of threat intelligence. Typically, organizations join a community based on
                                    their characteristics or common interests. For example, selecting a community based
                                    on geographical region may facilitate joining the regular meetings. Similarly,
                                    selecting a community based on an industrial sector, such as the energy sector, may
                                    be more closely focused on threats that are common in that industry. One important
                                    consideration for joining a sharing community is trust. An organizations’
                                    information-sharing rules should take into consideration the trustworthiness of the
                                    community members. </p>
