                                    subject for organizations provisioning accounts. An organization must start by
                                    defining the attribute “rule” architecture, subject definitions, and object
                                    definitions. These three considerations provide the foundation for authorization
                                    rules when provisioning accounts and should be explicitly documented within the
                                    organization preferably at a higher than the information systems level of the
                                    business. Consistent rule sets of valid values must be defined and actioned at an
                                    enterprise level for subjects and objects. Authorized decisions must be based on
                                    known, consistent values. The life cycle management of rules is always the
                                    responsibility of the provisioning organization whether access attribution occurs
                                    inside or outside the organization.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Attribute Architecture → Rules. </em>The access control relationship between
                                        data and accounts is dictated by policy attributes. All mandatory attributes
                                        should be defined and limited to acceptable values based on policies. These
                                        attributes and value limitations must be distributed to stakeholders to help
                                        enable owner organizations with rule and relationship development.</li>
                                    <li><em>Object Attributes → Data. </em>Data attributes should be assigned upon
                                        object creation. Object attributes are often dictated by business (non-security)
                                        processes and requirements. Attributed data should support logical access
                                        decisions while providing provisions for validation and audit. Subjects should
                                        not be capable of modifying data attributes to manipulate access control
                                        decisions.</li>

                                    creating object attributes are:</p>
                                <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 40px;">
                                    <li>Users will not know the values of an object attribute (e.g., to which sensitive

                                    <li>Attributes need to be kept consistent in digital and written policies. Tools and
                                        software must support business processes.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Subject Attributes → Account. </em>People subject attributes are provisioned
                                        upon involvement with an organization and could be provisioned by various
                                        authorities (e.g., human resources, security). This type of data access approach
                                        is well matured based on obtaining authoritative data. Account access attributes
                                        may include physical location or MAC address of a device from the request
                                        originator. Account attribute provisioning capabilities should be dependable,
                                        and the decision source should be authoritative. Quality, assurance, privacy,
                                        and service expectations should all be considered. Attribution for service
                                        accounts should be similar. Irrespective of machine or human interfacing,
                                        accounts should be monitored and audited with a level of rigor associated with
                                        access and object levels.</li>

                                <p class="comment78305">It is unrealistic to attempt to monitor every data interaction
                                    within an enterprise. Security practitioners must carefully align monitoring,
                                    logging, and auditing of accounts and object requests with respect to the
                                    sensitivity of data and privileges of accounts. An organization could monitor the
                                    status of authorized and unauthorized subject and object interactions on a network
                                    to aggregate metrics such as logical asset locations, MAC addresses, and
                                    policies/procedures for network connectivity. Metrics can be consolidated overtime
                                    and might be aggregated hourly, daily, or weekly in a progressive manner.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Security practitioners can also consider password policy
                                    implementations as a mechanism to ensure stale accounts are deactivated. Human users
                                    who fail to change their password within an organizationally defined time, such as
                                    90 days, should be deactivated. Likewise, service accounts that do not request
                                    objects within an organizationally defined time, such as 10 days, should be
                                    deactivated. Organizations define access metrics and monitoring frequencies in a way
                                    that supports business operations. In addition to defining access metrics,
                                    organizations determine how the information will be collected and delivered within
                                    business tiers as well as external to the organization.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Software architecture requirements should be functional and
                                    support data collection, storage, and analysis capabilities. The use of automated
                                    mechanisms and methodologies should be employed to allow for increased efficiencies
                                    and insight into access events. Data access and audit should be architected in a way
                                    that maximizes data reuse and limits data calls. Additionally, software developers
                                    and security personnel should embrace interoperable data specifications such as
                                    SCAP, XML, or JSON, when possible, to enable data reuse.</p>
