                                    is built, whereas verification remains focused on the assurance that the product is
                                    built right. The earlier in the life cycle the related software V&amp;V activities

                                    quality through document checks, walk-throughs, and other related activities. In

                                    validating the fitness for use of the system by the business user. The users and
                                    application managers perform the user acceptance test.</p>

                                    administrators prior to the system release to validate fitness for operations. It
                                    could include testing of backups through restoration or other continuity exercises
                                    which determine the operational readiness of software.</p>

                                    testing that is conducted when development is completed. It is normally carried out
                                    by internal teams/staff that did not have a direct involvement in the development of
                                    the software. Beta testing, which is conducted after alpha testing, is completed by
                                    a sample of the intended audience (e.g., customers) prior to the release of the
                                    software for public availability.</p>
