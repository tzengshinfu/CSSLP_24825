                                <p class="comment78305">Overall, security practitioners reviewing CSSLP Domain 2 need to
                                    understand the importance of various software development methodologies (e.g.,
                                    Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, etc.) that have been introduced over the years to meet the
                                    evolving needs of businesses. Agile methodologies help with the velocity of
                                    development, but security must be adapted to short development iterations. While
                                    DevOps and CI/CD are valuable in generating organizational returns, DevSecOps
                                    attempts to bridge the gap between DevOps and security. Agile development fosters
                                    continuous improvement, which creates opportunities for teams to regularly and
                                    frequently reflect on performance.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Compliance adds further complications, as most organizations are
                                    subject to a combination of industry-specific, state, national, or international
                                    regulations, laws, standards, or contractual obligations. Compliance can be seen as
                                    an organizational risk. Risk management is a continuous and iterative process that
                                    is best executed when secure software life cycle management has the same
                                    characteristics—continuous and iterative.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Continuous improvements in software-development life cycle
                                    (SDLC) processes are recommended, regardless of which software development process
                                    is adopted by an organization. Many factors determine an organization’s secure
                                    software life cycle management. At an enterprise level, organizational risk
                                    tolerance will play a role in determining funding and focus for security within
                                    software development teams. On a more micro level, software development team culture
                                    and individual contributor experiences with security are examples that may shape the
                                    implementation of security with respect to software development.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The most important takeaway is that security practitioners must
                                    understand the difference between operational security for software infrastructure,
                                    secure software development, and securing the development pipeline. Each of these
                                    areas of software security has life cycle considerations that security practitioners
                                    must observe, integrate safeguards, and establish monitoring and reporting. Failure
                                    to understand and implement security solutions in each phase of the life cycle will
                                    result in a lack of organizational cyber resiliency and the realization of risks.

                                    <li>A <u>multitiered security reporting</u> structure of three tiers:
                                        organizational, business process, and information systems is common within
                                        organizations.<ul>
                                            <li>The organizational tier provides the strategy and context for the entire
                                                organization, which includes lower-level reports. This level of the
                                                organization includes stakeholders such as the C-suite and the board of
                                                directors, as reporting must provide information that can be actioned at
                                                a high-level.</li>
                                            <li>The next tier down, business process, might be synonymous within some
                                                organizations with a department (e.g., IT department, security
                                                operations center). At this tier, reporting is consolidated from each
                                                system, software, or network appliance into dashboards and other visual
                                                methods that allow for situational awareness within the mission or
                                                operation of the organization</li>
                                            <li>At the lowest tier, we have information systems—end points. Reporting at
                                                this level is detailed and quantitative, with system logs, network logs,
                                                configuration baselines, and CVEs for software installed on hardware
                                                within the organization.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>DevSecOps Security Reporting:<ul>
                                            <li><u>Plan</u><i>:</i> Opportunities and risks can be captured and recorded
                                                within the risk register. If using Agile, then the backlog could provide
                                                context for reporting.</li>
                                            <li><u>Code/Build/Test</u>: Some Integrated development environments (IDE)
                                                can provide developers trustworthiness of third-party libraries or
                                                linter suggestions based on language style guides. Often before source
                                                code can be committed to a repository it must pass a gated check-in
                                                where unit, integration, and/or static analysis tests review the source
                                                code for defects.</li>
                                            <li><u>Release/Deploy/Operate/Monitor</u>: Once the source is branched into
                                                an official release there will be a final statement regarding the
                                                software risks and mitigations. The organization or authorizing official
                                                will use a document such as a system authorization package, sometimes
                                                referred to as SAP, to decide whether the software system is authorized
                                                to operate.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Feedback loops</b> (e.g., lesson learned, retrospectives) in reporting are
                                        integrally important to ensure stability and improvement over time within
                                        development processes. </li>

                                    <li>Organizations use <b>risk assessment,</b> the first step in the risk management
                                        methodology, to determine the extent of the potential threat, vulnerabilities,
                                        and the risk associated with an information technology (IT) system.</li>
                                    <li>The output of this process helps identify appropriate controls for reducing or
                                        eliminating risk during the <b>risk mitigation</b> process, the second step of
                                        risk management.</li>
                                    <li>The four primary risk strategies:<ul>
                                            <li><b>Mitigate:</b> Controls (safeguards and countermeasures) can be
                                                implemented to reduce or mitigate risk. Given time and resource
                                                availability, this is the best course of action when addressing risk.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><b>Accept:</b> When the cost of implementing controls outweighs the risk
                                                itself, risk can be accepted if the acceptance is properly documented
                                                and formally performed. Risk acceptance with an exception to policy may
                                                be necessary when the software has unfixable vulnerabilities due to some
                                                legacy components in the software that are no longer supported. Risk
                                                acceptance must be performed only after the <b>residual risk</b> is
                                                known and there are contingency plans in place to address the risk as
                                                soon as possible.</li>
                                            <li><b>Transfer:</b> When the cost of implementing controls outweighs the
                                                risk itself, risk can also be transferred by buying insurance, but this
                                                is not common. Another risk transference mechanism that is prevalent in
                                                the world of software is the use of disclaimers (“as is” clauses) and
                                                end-user licensing agreements (EULAs), which are instruments that can be
                                                used to transfer the risk to the end user.</li>
                                            <li><b>Avoid:</b> Risk can be avoided by discontinuing the use of the
                                                vulnerable software and/or replacing or upgrading it with a more secure
                                                version.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Avoiding risk is <i>different from</i> allowing risk to be ignored (left
                                        unhandled)—the latter is never a good practice.</li>
                                    <li><b>Residual risk</b> is a reference to the remaining, potential risk after all
                                        IT security measures are applied. Risk can never be zero.</li>
                                    <li><b>Risk monitoring</b> enables organizations to verify compliance, determine the
                                        ongoing effectiveness of <b>risk response</b> measures, and identify
                                        risk-impacting changes to organizational information systems and environments of
                                        operation. </li>
