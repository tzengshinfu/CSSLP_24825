                                    addressed at every architectural layer of a system. Security architecture aims to
                                    provide guidelines for the secure design (and secure layering of functionality) of
                                    software and systems. For systems designed absent of security architecture
                                    considerations, organizations will have to bolster security by layering many
                                    safeguards post-production to achieve an acceptable level of risk.</p>

                                    business needs to derive security architecture requirements. Cyber survivability
                                    requirements will often be drafted to address the business need for confidentiality,
                                    integrity, and availability of the software or system. This process often begins by
                                    defining critical components whose function is essential to mission success. Design
                                    decisions may be influenced by several factors, including legal and regulatory
                                    requirements, benchmarking and good practices, cost and finance, and risk management
                                    processes.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">According to OWASP, “The Security Architecture (SA) practice
                                    focuses on the security linked to components and technology you deal with during the
                                    architectural design of your software. Secure Architecture Design looks at the
                                    selection and composition of components that form the foundation of your solution,
                                    focusing on its security properties.”<sup>1</sup></p>

                                    framework can assist by providing a mechanism for classifying organizational
                                    architecture. Zachman is used to model preexisting organizational functions and
                                    processes while controlling business changes. The framework contains 36 categories
                                    for describing complex systems. These categories consist of six columns and six
                                    rows, which result in a two-dimensional matrix.</p>

                                    developed to inform information security architectures using a risk-based enterprise
                                    approach and includes guidance for service management. It shares many similarities
                                    with the Zachman Framework but was independently developed. SABSA provides a means
                                    to integrate multiple solutions while managing complexity. </p>
                                <p class="comment78305">SABSA includes four life cycle phases: Strategy and Planning,
                                    Design, Implementation, and Management and Measurement. The model contains six
                                    layers: context, concept, logic, physical, component, and operational. Similar to
                                    each row within Zachman, each SABSA layer has a domain or perspective. This aims to
                                    ensure that security is considered equitably from many organizational perspectives.

                                    preexisting systems. Physical, administrative, and technical controls may be
                                    categorized by the functionality provided. Security controls may help to prevent,
                                    deter, detect, or delay system disruptions or to correct and recover from security
                                    incidents.</p>

                                    may be used for deterring intruders or for detecting intrusions). Controls should be
                                    prioritized based on a range of criteria such as immediate need, security posture,
                                    complexity, resource availability, cost, and/or applicable regulations/standards.

                                <p class="comment78305">Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing utilizes an architecture with no
                                    special machine that provides a service or manages the network resources. Instead,
                                    all responsibilities are uniformly divided among all machines, known as peers. Peers
                                    can serve both as clients and servers. When one program controls other programs, as
                                    is usually the case with client/server architectures, it is said to have a
                                    master-and-slave configuration. However, in some distributed computing
                                    architectures, the client and the server programs each have the ability to initiate
                                    a transaction and act as peers; such a configuration is the defining characteristic
                                    of P2P architecture. Management of these resources in a P2P network is not
                                    centralized but spread among the resources on the P2P network uniformly, and each
                                    resource can function as a client or a server. File sharing programs and instant
                                    messaging are well-known examples of this type of architecture. P2P file sharing
                                    networks are a common ground for hackers to implant malware, so when P2P networks
                                    are designed, it is imperative to include strong access control protection to
                                    prevent the upload of malicious files from sources that are not trusted.</p>

                                    options to the architect. SOA offered an approach that helped address the
                                    interoperability challenge found in typical IT environments. Increased reusability
                                    was another benefit of SOA.</p>

                                    used for designing and implementing the interaction and communication between
                                    mutually interacting software applications in SOA. As a software architecture model
                                    for distributed computing, ESB is a specialty variant of the more general
                                    client-server software architecture model; it promotes strictly asynchronous
                                    message-oriented design for communication and interaction between applications. Its
                                    primary use is in enterprise application integration (EAI) of heterogeneous and

                                    XML-based open standards. Standards like Web Services Description Language (WSDL),
                                    Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and Universal Description, Discovery, and
                                    Integration (UDDI) provide the approach for defining, publishing and using web

                                    SOAP, web services have evolved. RESTful web services built on Representational
                                    State Transfer (REST) architecture were introduced by the web consortium subsequent
                                    to SOAP. These web services were built to work best on the web and provide the
                                    opportunity for the construction of fast, simple, and lightweight RESTful
                                    applications. Unlike SOAP, which is a protocol and relies strictly on XML for
                                    transport, REST is an architectural style that supports various formats (e.g.,

                                    web and mobile applications. Independence in this context implies that these
                                    services may even be developed using different programing languages and use
                                    different storage with no centralized management. Services are meant to be designed
                                    to serve a single specific function. Examples of functions could include e-commerce
                                    cart, social media login and user roles, among others. The following example depicts

                                    deployment scenarios may include single server, distributed, and high availability.
                                    Of these, the simplest configuration is the single server deployment. With all
                                    modules on a single node, management of security may also be simplified. In a
                                    distributed deployment scenario, multiple nodes will be involved. This can extend
                                    reliability and efficiency. High availability, a special type of multinode
                                    deployment, may require additional nodes and multiple instances of key processes.
                                    This type of deployment can result in built-in redundancy and automatic failover.

                                    of the characteristics of desktop application software (e.g., visual user interfaces
                                    with interactive components, drag-and-drop functionality, quick response to
                                    mouse-clicks, transition effects, animation), typically delivered by way of a
                                    site-specific browser, a browser plug-in, an independent sandbox, extensive use of
                                    JavaScript, or a virtual machine.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The list of frameworks/technologies used to build RIAs is long
                                    and includes HTML 5, AJAX and Angular. Some of the technologies that were initially
                                    used for building RIAs include Adobe Flash, JavaFX, and Microsoft Silverlight. They
                                    are examples of common RIA platforms that came with supporting runtime libraries,
                                    execution engines, and rendering mechanisms. These technologies (some widely used,
                                    and others as accepted) enabled developers to deliver expressive content (e.g.,
                                    streaming audio and video, 3D graphics) to users across browsers, desktops, and
                                    other devices. Various security concerns existed with these technologies.</p>

                                    is offloaded to the client as well), smaller footprint on the desktop, ability to be
                                    used from any computer with a web browser, applications updates that can be
                                    transparent to the user, and consistent experience regardless of browser or OS used.
                                    Other benefits include enhanced user experience, such as information sharing,
                                    collaboration, and functionality. RIA also gives more power to the end user as in

                                    Common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
                                    apply to RIAs as well (perhaps with a twist); however, since RIAs work differently
                                    from other types of web applications in certain aspects, there are also new
                                    opportunities to introduce vulnerabilities. As with other web applications, RIAs
                                    must be subjected to various security testing techniques and methods, including

                                    browser clients, with complex data validation and security rules, forgetting that
                                    these rules run in the user domain and can be disabled or bypassed by the user. All
                                    validation, authorization, and authentication must be done by the server. Data
                                    validation may be done by the client to help prevent unnecessary round trips to the
                                    server, but all validation must be backed up at the server as well. Solely trusting
                                    the client to validate the data and input can be easily circumvented and can
                                    potentially lead to serious server-side compromise. Never rely solely on the client

                                    Romine, director of NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory, testified before the
                                    U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation Subcommittee on
                                    Security, “Every sector has its own types of IoT devices, such as specialized
                                    hospital equipment in the healthcare sector and smart road technologies in the
                                    transportation sector,” and there are many enterprise IoT devices for every sector.
                                    “Versions of nearly every consumer electronics device, many of which are also
                                    present in organizations’ facilities, have become connected IoT devices.... Many
                                    organizations are not necessarily aware that they are using a large number of IoT
                                    devices. It is important that organizations understand their use of IoT because many
                                    IoT devices affect cybersecurity and privacy risks differently than conventional IT
                                    devices do.”<sup>3</sup></p>

                                    technologies can be found in all industries. Objects equipped with RFID tags can be
                                    identified, and the information stored on tags can be read wirelessly by RFID
                                    readers. Depending on the RFID technologies used (e.g., passive, active), the read
                                    range can vary, but is generally limited to short distances. RFID technologies have
                                    also been used for location identification and tracking/tracing purposes.</p>

                                    require direct user input or interactions. Typically, embedded systems are
                                    associated with smaller devices with smaller processors and minimal OS designed for

                                    systems are likely cost-sensitive with computational limitations, leaving limited
                                    room for security considerations (e.g., processing of encryption with large key
                                    lengths). One implication is that this can create a barrier for the application of
                                    best practices and implementation of resource intensive safeguards. This may present
                                    some challenges, but at the same time highlights the need for device makers and
                                    software developers to make security a high priority and address the patching and
                                    updating of the software. Examples of embedded systems include computers in
                                    automobiles, wearables, and appliances.</p>

                                    following: “Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient,
                                    on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g.,
                                    networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly
                                    provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider
                                    interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three
                                    service models, and four deployment models.”<sup>5</sup></p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The benefits of cloud computing for business and IT include
                                    efficiency, cost reduction, flexibility, and scalability on demand. The most notable
                                    benefit of the adoption of cloud computing for the organization is touted as the
                                    ability to transition from capital expenditure (CapEx) to operation expenditure
                                    (OpEx). Specific benefits of the adoption of cloud computing to the organization
                                    would be tied to each service model: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as
                                    a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). Organizational benefits from
                                    cloud computing vary by deployment model—private, public, community, or hybrid.</p>

                                    software applications are hosted by a vendor or cloud service provider and made
                                    available to customers over network resources. SaaS is currently the most widely
                                    used and adopted form of cloud computing, with users most often needing nothing more
                                    than an internet connection and credentials to have full use of the cloud service,
                                    application, and data housed. Within SaaS, there are two delivery models currently
                                    used. First is hosted application management (hosted AM), where a cloud provider
                                    hosts commercially available software for customers and delivers it over the web
                                    (internet). Second is software on demand, where a cloud provider provides customers
                                    with network-based access to a single copy of an application created specifically
                                    for SaaS distribution (typically within the same network segment). Within either
                                    delivery model, SaaS can be implemented with a custom application, or the customer
                                    may acquire a vendor-specific application that can be tailored to the customer.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Public cloud. </em>Delivered over the internet, computing resources (e.g.,
                                        hardware and software) are owned and managed by the cloud service provider
                                        (CSP). The public cloud is a multitenant environment where the computing
                                        infrastructure is shared by tenants. This is the most common type of cloud and
                                        the least costly as compared to the other types.</li>
                                    <li><em>Private cloud. </em>Computing infrastructure exclusively used by a single
                                        organization, which can result in enhanced security and greater control over
                                        critical operations. As expected, single tenancy also results in higher costs as
                                        compared to other types of cloud. Private cloud is often used by larger
                                        organizations (e.g., financial institutions) and government agencies.</li>
                                    <li><em>Community cloud. </em>A multitenant environment that differs from a public
                                        cloud in the sense that the tenants (organizations) likely have similar needs
                                        and concerns. As expected, costs will likely be higher than the public cloud,
                                        but less than a private cloud. When compliance and regulatory measures are key
                                        requirements (e.g., in government or healthcare), community cloud could be a
                                        viable solution.</li>
                                    <li><em>Hybrid cloud. </em>Not every service or application must be hosted in a
                                        private cloud, and not every organization is ready or willing to entirely
                                        dismantle its own data centers and migrate everything into the cloud. A
                                        combination of on-premises infrastructure or private cloud with the public cloud
                                        could be advantageous and offer great flexibility. Bursting out of a private
                                        cloud and into a public cloud during peak demand times (e.g., tax filing season)
                                        for software services is an example of the flexibility mentioned.</li>

                                    typically consists either of spinning hard disk drives or solid-state drives (SSDs).
                                    For reliability purposes, disk drives are often grouped to provide redundancy.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Cloud providers also provide object storage, a method for
                                    storing unstructured data using the concept of units or objects rather than a
                                    traditional file system. The objects (files) are stored with additional metadata
                                    (content type, redundancy required, creation date, etc.) that are accessible through
                                    programming or web interfaces. Volume storage is a virtual hard drive that can be
                                    attached to a virtual machine instance and be used to host data within a file
                                    system. Storage is written to committed blocks of data. Volumes attached to IaaS
                                    instances behave just like a physical drive or an array.</p>

                                    that provides access to consolidated, block-level data storage. SANs are primarily
                                    used to enhance storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical
                                    jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear to the operating system
                                    as locally attached devices. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices
                                    that are generally not accessible through the local area network (LAN) by other
                                    devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels
                                    allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small-to-medium-sized business

                                    provides data access to a heterogeneous group of clients. NAS is often manufactured
                                    as a computer appliance, a purpose-built, specialized computer that serves files
                                    using its hardware, software, or configuration. NAS systems are networked appliances
                                    that contain one or more storage drives, often arranged into logical, redundant
                                    storage containers or redundant array of independent disks (RAID). NAS removes the
                                    responsibility of file serving from other servers on the network. It typically
                                    provides access to files using network file sharing protocols such as NFS, SMB/CIFS,

                                    a client-server architecture, so there is a client component and a server component.
                                    The client component runs on the device, which operates by means of Android, iOS, or
                                    some other mobile OS. The client app, which is what the user interacts with to pay
                                    bills or send a secure message, for example, is the mobile application from user’s
                                    perspective. This is the piece that is downloaded from the app store and installed
                                    on the device.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The other component, the server, is hosted somewhere on the
                                    premises or in the cloud and is what the client component interacts with. The server
                                    component is important, as this is where data is stored and processed. Interaction
                                    between the client and the server is over the internet using some form of
                                    application programming interface (API).</p>

                                    concern. Preventions for Integrated Circuits (IC) hardware exploits are complex and
                                    difficult to implement. They are typically remediated by upgrading hardware,
                                    securing supply chains, and manual inspections. Hardware firmware patches are issued
                                    less frequently than software updates, and patch management systems are not
                                    streamlined for updating hardware and firmware across a diverse range of
                                    manufacturers. Finally, the knowledge and skill set required for updating computer
                                    hardware and firmware, especially network appliances, is different than patching
                                    endpoint software. As a result, remediation for hardware vulnerabilities may be
                                    neglected or may not receive the attention we provide to software vulnerabilities.

                                    performance. When speculative execution is utilized, the microprocessor will use
                                    ideal clock cycles to execute a block of upcoming instructions before its time. For
                                    example, rather than waiting for the outcome of a condition that determines the flow
                                    of the execution in one of the two paths, the microprocessor executes based on a
                                    speculated path. When the result of the condition is determined, the processor
                                    either abandons the result of the speculated execution or leaps ahead. Since
                                    speculative execution results in microprocessors executing a set of instructions,
                                    the executed code may leave a residue of sensitive information in the computer cache

                                    keys. HSM is used for generation, storage and provisioning of crypto keys and

                                    practice, machine learning works. At a high level, data is selected and structured
                                    then fed into a machine learning algorithm, that may be supervised or unsupervised,
                                    and the output is a machine learning model. The model is used to make predictions
                                    based on future data inputs. The process of using data and algorithms to create a
                                    model is called training. The data used for training is normally multiparameter.
                                    Each data attribute selected to train the model is commonly referred to as a

                                <p class="comment78305">Threats to ICS can come from numerous sources, which can be
                                    classified as adversarial, accidental, structural, and environmental.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Although this guide provides guidance for securing ICS, other
                                    types of control systems share similar characteristics and many of the
                                    recommendations from this guide are applicable and could be used as a reference to
                                    protect such systems against cybersecurity threats. For example, although many
                                    building, transportation, medical, security and logistics systems use different
                                    protocols, ports and services, and are configured and operate in different modes
                                    than ICS, they share similar characteristics to traditional ICS.”<sup>8</sup></p>
