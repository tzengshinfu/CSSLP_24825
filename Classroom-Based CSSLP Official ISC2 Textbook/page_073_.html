                                    automated solutions to lower costs, enhance efficiency, and improve the reliability
                                    of monitoring security-related information. Security is implemented through a
                                    combination of people, processes, and technology. The automation of information
                                    security deals primarily with automating aspects of security that require little
                                    human interaction. Automated tools are often able to recognize patterns and
                                    relationships that may escape the notice of human analysts, especially when the
                                    analysis is performed on large volumes of data. This includes items such as
                                    verifying technical settings on individual network endpoints or ensuring that the
                                    software on a machine is up to date with organizational policy. Automation serves to
                                    augment the security processes conducted by security professionals within an
                                    organization and may reduce the amount of time a security professional must spend on
                                    redundant tasks, thereby increasing the amount of time the trained professional may
                                    spend on tasks requiring human cognition.<sup>13</sup></p>

                                    organizationâ€™s systems and networks. Logs are composed of individual entries,Â each
                                    containing information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system
                                    or system component.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Originally, logs were used primarily for troubleshooting
                                    problems, but logs now serve many functions within most organizations, such as
                                    optimizing system and network performance, recording the actions of users, and
                                    providing data useful for investigating malicious activity. Logs have evolved to
                                    contain information related to many different types of events occurring within
                                    networks and systems. Within an organization, many logs contain records related to
                                    computer security; common examples of these computer security logs are audit logs
                                    that track user authentication attempts and security device logs that record
                                    possible attacks.<sup>15</sup></p>

                                    disposing of security log data. Log management is essential for ensuring that
                                    security records are stored in sufficient detail for an appropriate period. Logs are
                                    a key resource when performing auditing and forensic analysis, supporting internal
                                    investigations, establishing baselines, and identifying operational trends and
                                    longterm problems. Routine log analysis is beneficial for identifying security
                                    incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activity, and operational problems, and as
                                    such, supports an ISCM capability.<sup><span style="font-size: 10.8333px;"

                                <p class="comment78305">Intrusion prevention is the process of performing intrusion
                                    detection and attempting to stop possible incidents as they are detected. Intrusion
                                    detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) are typically used to record information
                                    related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed
                                    events, and automatically generate reports. Then, after human review of the report,
                                    remediation actions are manually performed. Many IDPSs can also be configured to
                                    respond to a detected threat using a variety of techniques, including changing
                                    security configurations or blocking the attack.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Within the context of an ISCM program, IDPSs can be used to
                                    supply evidence of the effectiveness of security controls (e.g., policies,
                                    procedures, and other implemented technical controls), document existing threats,
                                    and deter unauthorized use of information systems.<sup>17</sup></p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The key difference between an intrusion detection system (IDS)
                                    and an intrusion prevention system (IPS) is that although they appear similar, an
                                    IDS is a passive security system, much like a warning light in a car. When the
                                    sensor that controls the light detects an anomaly, it alerts the driver. Similarly,
                                    when an IDS detects an anomaly, it alerts the administrator.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">An IPS system is more like an airbag. When the carâ€™s sensors
                                    detect a collision, they activate the airbag to keep the vehicle occupants safe.
                                    Similarly, the IPS activates some means of protective action to keep the network
                                    safe.</p>

                                    deployment, problems could still arise after the production release, which may stem
                                    from corner-case issues having been missed in test environment. This could be
                                    because testing was performed using test data as opposed to real production data.
                                    There may also be issues resulting from manual build deployment processes. This
                                    could be due to different configuration settings or missing configuration files,
                                    missing database scripts, dependencies that were installed incorrectly, or other
