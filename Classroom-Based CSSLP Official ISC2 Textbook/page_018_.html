                                <p class="comment78305">Over the years, variations of noniterative (e.g., waterfall) and
                                    iterative (e.g., Agile) SDLC methodologies have been introduced. Agile methodologies
                                    help with the velocity of development, but security must be adapted to short
                                    development iterations. While DevOps and CI/CD are valuable in generating
                                    organizational returns, DevSecOps attempts to bridge the gap between DevOps and
                                    security. Agile development fosters continuous improvement, which creates
                                    opportunities for teams to regularly and frequently reflect on performance. It is
                                    important to ensure security is part of the development team's considerations and
                                    feedback mechanisms.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">As demonstrated, there are many considerations for providing
                                    effective software security to organizations. For security practitioners to take due
                                    care and exhibit due diligence, organizational software must be protected with
                                    respect to the organizationally defined software-development life cycle. Each
                                    organization is unique with respect to software security solutions. Security
                                    practitioners must map risk management and business processes to preexisting
                                    software practices to identify gaps and integrate secure software practices within
                                    the software life cycle.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Security-relevant documentation is needed in each phase of the
                                    SDLC. Some documentation and reporting, such as secure software development
                                    policies, establish a foundation for subsequent processes, procedures, and
                                    reportingâ€”such as the implementation of static code analysis or cyclomatic
                                    complexity checking prior to committing changes to a repository. Various approaches
                                    for software security metrics exist. Attack surface analysis is an established
                                    method used by developers to understand and manage application security risks as
                                    they design and change an application. Organizations must establish policies and
                                    processes for secure decommissioning. The risk of data remanence must be addressed
                                    using appropriate data destruction methods and techniques. An inventory of all
                                    authorized software used by the organization must be established.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The most important takeaway is that security practitioners must
                                    understand the difference between operational security for software infrastructure,
                                    secure software development, and securing the development pipeline. Each of these
                                    areas of software security has life cycle considerations that security practitioners
                                    must observe, integrate safeguards, and establish monitoring and reporting. Failure
                                    to understand and implement security solutions of life cycles will result in a lack
                                    of organizational cyber resiliency and the realization of risks.</p>
