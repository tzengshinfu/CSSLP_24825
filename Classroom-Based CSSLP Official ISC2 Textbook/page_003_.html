                                    within an Active Directory domain, where a user logs on once to a domain controller,
                                    is ultimately granted an access token, and uses that token to gain access to systems
                                    for which the user has authorization. The difference is that while Kerberos works
                                    well in a single domain, federated identities allow for the generation of tokens
                                    (authentication) in one domain and the consumption of these tokens (authorization)

                                    to send and receive messages with the intent of simplification and uncomplication.
                                    The focus of OpenID Connect is to confirm the identity of the person consuming

                                    authentication for some years, but the perception of biometrics as being less
                                    acceptable compared to the traditional password approach may no longer be true.
                                    Perhaps more frequently observed in the mobile world, usage of biometrics has gained

                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Network sniffing. </em>The capturing, decoding, inspecting, and interpreting
                                        of information inside a network data packet on a Transmission Control
                                        Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network to steal information such as user
                                        IDs, passwords, network details, and credit card numbers. Sniffing is considered
                                        a “passive” attack because the attackers can be silent/invisible on the network,
                                        making it difficult to detect, thus a dangerous type of attack.</li>
                                    <li><em>Shoulder surfing. </em>This occurs when an individual looks over another
                                        individual’s shoulder, watching keystrokes/data as they appear on the screen. A
                                        common concern with shoulder surfing is at ATMs. Notice that many ATMs warn the
                                        customer to cover the number pad while entering their PIN.</li>
                                    <li><em>Social engineering. </em>This is tricking an authorized user into revealing
                                        confidential information, such as company trade secrets. For example, a person
                                        using social engineering to break into a computer network would gain the
                                        confidence of an authorized user and leverage that person to compromise network
                                        security.</li>
                                    <li><em>Hacking. </em>This is bypassing a system’s access controls by taking
                                        advantage of security weaknesses in the system. Hackers are often able to
                                        discover the passwords of authorized users, create copies of inadequately
                                        protected files, and place them in areas of the system where unauthorized
                                        persons can access them.</li>
                                    <li><em>Masquerading. </em>This is an (authorized or unauthorized) system user
                                        posing as another authorized user. By obtaining and using the authorized user’s
                                        password, the masquerader gains access to the authorized user’s confidential
                                        files to read and/or copy them.</li>
                                    <li><em>Unprotected downloaded files. </em>This can compromise confidential
                                        information if, in the process, files are moved from the secure environment of a
                                        host computer to an unprotected microcomputer for local processing.</li>
                                    <li><em>Trojan. </em>Typically, this is a malicious clickable attachment that is
                                        disguised as some other file. Once executed, the system resources are
                                        compromised in numerous ways.</li>
                                    <li><em>Unencrypted (cleartext) data. </em>Sometimes due to misconfiguration or
                                        other failures, information such as passwords or sensitive information such as
                                        personal health information (PHI) or personal identity information (PII) could
                                        be stored or transmitted in a way that is easily intercepted and viewed by
                                        authorized parties.</li>

                                    the produced digest. Hashing provides an opportunity to detect undesired alterations
                                    including tampering. The table below highlights two properties of hashing. Firstly,
                                    taking the hash of the same data multiple times should produce the same hash.
                                    Secondly, a slight change in the message results in a significant change in the SHA
                                    256 digest.</p>

                                    most basic form, practices are introduced to minimize the opportunity for

                                <p class="comment78305">One example of such a practice is integrity in source code
                                    version control. Although version control may apply to all sorts of collections of
                                    information, software professionals can certainly relate to the need to subject
                                    their source code to version control practices and tools designed for that purpose.
                                    Changes are identified and tracked through revision indicators using letter codes,
                                    numbers, and other symbols. The changes are time stamped and the subjects who make
                                    those changes are tracked. Revisions are compared and revisions are restored or
                                    merged. There are various proprietary and open-source tools available for this
                                    purpose, such as CVS, Subversion, GIT, and others.</p>

                                    of data. With that broad definition, if the TCB integrity is compromised (i.e., if
                                    malware is running), it can be assumed that security policy can no longer be
                                    enforced. A dedicated microcontroller called Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is an
                                    example of a cryptographic key that can be used to attest to the integrity of a boot
                                    process. Microsoft BitLocker would be an example that takes advantage of the TPM
                                    chip.</p>

                                    no single subject has control of a transaction from beginning to end; two or more
                                    subjects should be responsible for performing it. According to NIST, separation of
                                    duties refers to the principle that no user should be given enough privileges to
                                    misuse the system on their own. Separation of duties can be enforced statically
                                    through access control rules or dynamically using considerations like time of day.

                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Redundancy. </em>Mainly continuing the running of an organization even with
                                        the absence/failure of one important component. Redundancy in DBMS means copying
                                        data within a database or using a separate data storage technology in two
                                        separate places.</li>
                                    <li><em>Failover. </em>Switching to a redundant or standby computer server, system,
                                        hardware component, or network upon the failure or abnormal termination of the
                                        previously active application, server, system, hardware component, or network.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><em>Fault tolerance. </em>The system remains working as expected even when some
                                        of its components are failing.</li>
                                    <li><em>RAID. </em>A redundant array of independent disks (RAID) is a data storage
                                        virtualization technology that combines multiple physical disk-drive components
                                        into a single logical unit for the purposes of data redundancy, performance
                                        improvement, or both.</li>
                                    <li><em>High-availability clusters (failover clusters). </em>These are groups of
                                        computers that support server applications that can be reliably utilized with a
                                        minimum of downtime. They operate by using high-availability software to harness
                                        redundant computers in groups or clusters that provide continued service when
                                        system components fail.</li>
                                    <li><em>Replication. </em>This is the process of storing data in more than one site
                                        or node. As an example, directory services replication is often used to prevent
                                        the loss of a single server which would otherwise cause the directory service to
                                        become unavailable.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    becoming commonplace. Depending on a company’s requirements and obligations, and its
                                    appetite for service outage or data loss, solutions offered by cloud service
                                    providers (CSPs) should be taken into serious consideration. Global CSPs provide
                                    physical data centers across the globe. They likely offer availability zones made up
                                    of one or more data centers equipped with independent power, cooling, and
                                    networking. These availability zones could allow customers to run their
                                    mission-critical applications with high availability and low-latency replication.
                                    Taking this further, CSPs may also offer regions that typically consist of two or
                                    more availability zones intended to ensure operational redundancy. For example, it
                                    would be common for an organization to have its production environment in one region

                                    single point of failure or compromise should be considered. In every realm of
                                    security—software security included—the need for identifying and addressing such
                                    points is critical. Keep in mind that many times these single points of failure are
                                    introduced by the architectural and design decisions that we make. In many cases,
                                    elimination of failure points could involve a significant level of effort.</p>

                                    However, there are distinct differences that security practitioners should
                                    understand. Think about a scenario where an organization’s layers of defense (e.g.,
                                    restricted access control, encryption of data at rest, and data retention policies)
                                    have successfully secured data, but have simultaneously violated privacy law by
                                    collecting user data without explicit consent.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Globally, there are numerous laws, regulations, and other legal
                                    requirements for organizations and entities to protect the security and privacy of
                                    digital and other information assets. Across multiple territories and geographic
                                    locations, privacy laws and regulations require the implementation of measures to
                                    adequately protect personal and personally identifiable information (PII). This
                                    includes protection from unauthorized access, modification, loss, amendment, or
                                    alteration. Furthermore, failure to protect PII potentially results in legal
                                    challenges, fines, and imposed actions (including restrictions around the processing
                                    and collection of personal information). When these consequences are added to the
                                    possibility of nonlegal impacts such as reputational damage, loss of consumer and
                                    customer confidence, and competitive disadvantages, they exert significant pressure
                                    on entities to display compliance and due care.</p>

                                    security in software. Logs should avoid recording sensitive data where and when such
                                    avoidance is possible. Logs must be collected from various sources, normalized, and
                                    correlated. Digital signatures can help with the assurance of integrity and
                                    authenticity. Blockchain enables global visibility of a shared transaction

                                <p class="comment78305">The main function of logging is to provide documentary evidence
                                    regarding the sequence of events, and as such, auditing may rely on it. In fact,
                                    many security-relevant activities within the enterprise rely on proper logging of
                                    events of interest. Logs also enable a vast number of stakeholders to perform their
                                    job duties. Stakeholders include administrators, developers, support staff, and
                                    certainly security, privacy, and compliance personnel, among many others—each with
                                    their own set of needs and expectations from these logs. Acknowledging this broad
                                    range of subjects interested in logs underscores the need to identify these
                                    stakeholders and capture their requirements during the early stages of the software
                                    development life cycle. This crucial input is frequently overlooked, much to the
                                    detriment of decisions made without it.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">This discussion also provides an opportunity to make a
                                    distinction between application trace logs, which are primarily intended for
                                    software developers’ debugging and troubleshooting purposes, and other types of logs
                                    that serve various other purposes. Further, it is important to understand that logs
                                    in general may, and likely will, contain sensitive information captured
                                    intentionally or accidentally. This can result in serious issues if the logs are
                                    exposed.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">For example, consider an Android text messaging app that
                                    transmits diagnostic information captured from the device in the logs for the
                                    purpose of troubleshooting by the support and engineering teams. Now imagine that
                                    the information captured in the logs also included the physical location of the
                                    device and/or the body of the text message that was transmitted by the app. This
                                    hypothetical scenario is certainly possible in real life, as developers tend to
                                    think the more information they can include in these logs, the better the logs will
                                    serve the purpose of troubleshooting.</p>

                                    in size rapidly. Reviewing the logs for the purpose of identifying anomalies (i.e.,
                                    signs of compromise) without specialized solutions and technologies would be no easy

                                    mind that creating a digital signature includes the following steps:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Using a one-way cryptographic hash function to create a digest from the input.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Encrypting the digest (using an asymmetric algorithm) that was created from the
                                        previous step, using the private key of the signer.</li>

                                    execute legal orders, has important implications for GRC. Organizational software is
                                    either hosted within cloud infrastructure or interacts with various entities via the
                                    internet. Communications may transverse multiple countries while involving the
                                    interaction of citizens from many different legal systems.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Security practitioners must understand and advise that laws
                                    apply within internet infrastructure and cloud. In some extreme cases, laws may
                                    conflict between jurisdictions. Although the Internet lacks physically defined
                                    boundaries, applications are still bound to geographical and jurisdictional
                                    boundaries in which they operate. Some considerations which make jurisdiction
                                    complex for internet enabled applications include:</p>

                                    security of development environments while ensuring that software developed is
                                    secure to an acceptable level. Security practitioners leverage software tools to aid
                                    with these objectives, which may include GRC. Further, organizations must leverage
                                    automation and software tools to centralize and streamline processes. There are
                                    several commercially viable GRC products that can automate and reduce documentation.
