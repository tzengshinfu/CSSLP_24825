                                    is relevant to deployment and operations of software. When implemented, least
                                    privilege can help with overall system stability. Hardening is necessary to protect
                                    the system and its critical components against accidental or intentional misuse and
                                    attacks. Various software activation mechanisms may be used to verify compliance
                                    with software license agreements. Software security policy must address the

                                    are new possibilities for building a trustworthy computing platform.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">As discussed previously, the trusted computing base (TCB), the
                                    collection of hardware, software, firmware, and basic operating system services and
                                    processes, must provide security guarantees and a computing environment where
                                    security policies can be enforced. Unfortunately, attacks and compromise of the TCB
                                    may occur as early as the boot time, and that makes it essential to address the
                                    security of the bootstrap mechanism. From a technical perspective, security may
                                    involve an immutable bootstrap process, checking digital signatures, or taking other
                                    steps.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The bootstrap mechanism typically involves:</p>

                                    measures. Life cycle of the key begins with key generation. A device or program used
                                    to generate keys is called a key generator and can be an integral part of many

                                    require the TPM, providing protection of the encryption key. With that said, it
                                    should be noted that vulnerabilities with TPM chips have also been discovered and

                                    software. There are many reasons for this. Most obviously, hacking hardware
                                    generally requires physical access, whereas software does not. Additionally, there
                                    aren’t as many known and publicized vulnerabilities associated with hardware as

                                    discussed in previous chapters.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">According to NIST AC-6, “Organizations employ least privilege
                                    for specific duties and information systems. The principle of least privilege is
                                    also applied to information system processes, ensuring that the processes operate at
                                    privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational
                                    missions/business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional
                                    processes, roles, and information system accounts as necessary, to achieve least
                                    privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege to the development,
                                    implementation, and operation of organizational information systems.”<sup>10</sup>
                                </p>
                                <p class="comment78305">This principle is relevant to deployment and operations of
                                    software. When implemented, least privilege can help with overall system stability
                                    (e.g., damage that malicious or misbehaving processes can inflict) and enhanced
                                    security (e.g., limiting access of a process to certain resources).</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">With that said, implementing least privilege with precision can
                                    be challenging in practice, particularly with respect to processes and their needed
                                    privileges for accessing and operating on resources.</p>

                                    operating environment surrounding an organization’s software to bolster the security
                                    posture of applications deployed. The Environment Hardening (EH) Practice focuses on
                                    building assurance for the runtime environment that hosts the organization’s
                                    software. Since secure operation of an application can be deteriorated by problems
                                    in external components, hardening this underlying infrastructure directly improves
                                    the overall security posture of the software.<sup>11</sup></p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Security hardening is an iterative process. Hardening is
                                    necessary to protect the system and its critical components against accidental or
                                    intentional misuse and attacks. As discussed earlier, hardening eliminates certain
                                    attack vectors, reducing the overall attack surface and risk. Where and when
                                    possible, unnecessary programs, accounts, access, ports, and permissions should be
                                    removed or disabled.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Hardening to the highest levels possible (at least for critical
                                    components) is desirable but may not be feasible or practical. When the operating
                                    environment, operating systems, web servers, and application servers are hardened,
                                    it is likely that applications will experience problems or not function at all. This
                                    is why hardening and proper testing should be first attempted in a nonproduction
                                    environment (one that mirrors the production environment) to avoid business
                                    disruptions.</p>

                                    software’s end-user license agreement.</p>
