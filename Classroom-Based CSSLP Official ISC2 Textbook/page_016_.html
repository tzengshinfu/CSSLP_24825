                                    and the controls in place for the IT system. Impact refers to the magnitude of harm

                                    <li><em>Mitigate. </em>Controls (safeguards and countermeasures) can be implemented
                                        to reduce or mitigate risk. Given time and resource availability, this is the
                                        best course of action when addressing risk.</li>
                                    <li><em>Accept. </em>When the cost of implementing controls outweighs the risk
                                        itself, risk can be accepted if the acceptance is properly documented and
                                        formally performed. Risk acceptance with an exception to policy may be necessary
                                        when the software has unfixable vulnerabilities due to some legacy components in
                                        the software that are no longer supported. Risk acceptance must be performed
                                        only after the <strong><button

                                                class="rendered">residual risk</button> </strong>is known and there are
                                        contingency plans in place to address the risk as soon as possible.</li>
                                    <li><em>Transfer. </em>When the cost of implementing controls outweighs the risk
                                        itself, risk can also be transferred by buying insurance, but this is not
                                        common. Another risk transference mechanism that is prevalent in the world of
                                        software is the use of disclaimers (“as is” clauses) and end-user licensing
                                        agreements (EULAs), which are instruments that can be used to transfer the risk
                                        to the end user.</li>
                                    <li><em>Avoid. </em>Risk can be avoided by discontinuing the use of the vulnerable
                                        software and/or replacing or upgrading it with a more secure version. It is
                                        important to note that avoiding risk is <em>not </em>the same as allowing risk
                                        to be ignored (left unhandled)—the latter is never a good practice.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="comment78305">Note that ISO/IEC 27005:2018 rebrands the definitions in risk

                                    <li><em>Sharing. </em>The risk is shared with another party (e.g., contractual,

                                    after all IT security measures are applied. The term residual risk is typically used
                                    in relation to inherent risk or total risk. Organizations typically determine the
                                    inherent risk during the risk assessment process and follow a set of steps to arrive
                                    at the residual risk. The process for adjudicating risk is not universal, so
                                    approach will vary between organizations based on methodology and risk tolerance.

                                    remaining compliant. A good example would be compliance changes that were introduced
                                    when the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in 2018. Another
                                    example would be New York State Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity
                                    Requirements for Financial Services, which also took effect in 2018.</p>

                                    IP rights can be sold, transferred, or inherited.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">WIPO states, “A patent is an exclusive right granted for an
                                    invention—a product or process that provides a new way of doing something, or that
                                    offers a new technical solution to a problem. A patent provides patent owners with
                                    protection for their inventions. Protection is granted for a limited period,
                                    generally 20 years…. Patents are granted by national patent offices or by regional
                                    offices that carry out examination work for a group of countries—for example, the
                                    European Patent Office (EPO) and the African Intellectual Property Organization
                                    (OAPI). Under such regional systems, an applicant requests protection for an
                                    invention in one or more countries, and each country decides whether to offer patent
                                    protection within its borders. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
                                    administers the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which provides for the filing of a
                                    single international patent application that has the same effect as national
                                    applications filed in the designated countries.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">“Copyright covers literary works (such as novels, poems, and
                                    plays), films, music, artistic works (e.g., drawings, paintings, photographs, and
                                    sculptures) and architectural design. Rights related to copyright include those of
                                    performing artists in their performances, producers of phonograms in their
                                    recordings, and broadcasters in their radio and television programs.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">A trademark is a distinctive sign that identifies certain goods
                                    or services produced or provided by an individual or a company…. Trademark
                                    protection ensures that the owners of marks have the exclusive right to use them to
                                    identify goods or services, or to authorize others to use them in return for
                                    payment. The period of protection varies, but a trademark can be renewed
                                    indefinitely upon payment of the corresponding fees. Trademark protection is legally
                                    enforced by courts that, in most systems, have the authority to stop trademark
                                    infringement.”<sup>20</sup></p>

                                    is trade secrets. Trade secrets consist of information and can include a formula,

                                    In fact, many software defects that result in security issues are due to flaws in a
                                    system’s architecture and design. As described by US-CERT, the architectural risk
                                    assessment process entails identification of flaws in software architecture and
                                    determination of risks to information assets due to those flaws.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Through the process of architectural risk assessment, flaws are
                                    found that expose information assets to risk, risks are prioritized based on their
                                    impact to the business, mitigations for those risks are developed and implemented,
                                    and the software is reassessed to determine the efficacy of the mitigations.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Architectural risk assessment studies vulnerabilities and
                                    threats that may be malicious or non-malicious in nature. Whether the
                                    vulnerabilities are exploited intentionally (malicious) or unintentionally
                                    (non-malicious), the net result is that the confidentiality, integrity, and/or
                                    availability of the organization’s assets may be harmed. Risk management and risk
                                    transfer instruments deal with unmitigated vulnerabilities.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">One of the strengths of conducting risk assessment at the
                                    architectural level is the ability to see the relationships and impacts at a system
                                    level. In practice, this means assessing vulnerabilities not just at a component or
                                    function level but also at interaction points. Use case models help to illustrate
                                    the relationships among system components. The architecture risk analysis should
                                    factor these relationships into the vulnerabilities analysis and consider
                                    vulnerabilities that may emerge from these combinations.</p>

                                    to the subtle (symmetric key management). Static code checkers, runtime code
                                    checkers, profiling tools, penetration testing tools, stress test tools, and
                                    application scanning tools can find some security bugs in code, but they do not
                                    address architectural problems. When performing a known vulnerability analysis,
                                    consider the architecture as it has been described in the artifacts that were

                                    and the developers’ implementation of the software’s actions. It is vital to acquire

                                    vulnerabilities, and interaction vulnerabilities resulting from the interaction of
