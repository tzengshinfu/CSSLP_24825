                                    third-party components and libraries. Software security practitioners must
                                    understand the great and real risk of using these libraries with known
                                    vulnerabilities. The sole task of identifying these commercial or open-source
                                    components could present a great challenge. Further, these libraries may be updated
                                    and patched over time, and this highlights the need for the continuity of the risk
                                    assessment processes using automated and manual processes.</p>

                                    APIs for specific functions within their overall software products. These components
                                    provide a plug-and-play opportunity for development teams and eliminate the need to
                                    reinvent and develop the capabilities from scratch. For all the benefits of
                                    third-party components, there are also concerns and drawbacks. These include
                                    relinquishing control over the development processes of the code and relying on
                                    third parties to update and maintain the security of their components.</p>

                                    one part of the problem. Obtaining software components from unverified sources,
                                    acquiring components over insecure links, or even using older versions of components
                                    that are not maintained (unpatched) are a few other issues among a much longer list
                                    of issues pertaining to the use of third-party code or libraries. Static analysis

                                    and interfaces has enabled a large amount of code that would have been custom
                                    developed in the past to instead be written once by someone and reused by many.
                                    Frequently, the code is not written by the developers of the system or application
                                    in which the code will be used, or even by developers in the same organization.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The practice of software reuse, which began as a means of
                                    helping developers leverage their own well-engineered custom code and that of other
                                    developers in their organization, has long since evolved into use of third-party and
                                    open-source libraries of interfaces, protocols, and functions; software development
                                    kits (SDKs); wrappers; application frameworks; and a variety of other third-party
                                    software components—the pedigree and provenance of which is often obscure and
                                    sometimes unknowable.</p>

                                    may still contain vulnerabilities. The original developers could have been careless
                                    or malicious, or it could have been dangerously tampered with at some point between
                                    its original release and its acquisition by the development team that plans to reuse

                                    guidance and governance to organizations looking to reduce third-party and
                                    open-source risk. Policies typically include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Restrictions on component age</li>
                                    <li>Restrictions on outdated and EOL/EOS components</li>
                                    <li>Prohibition of components with known vulnerabilities</li>
                                    <li>Restrictions on public repository usage</li>
                                    <li>Restrictions on acceptable licenses</li>
                                    <li>Component update requirements</li>

                                    restrictions, it provides an organization’s security, development, and legal teams
                                    an opportunity to create solutions for healthy open-source usage.</p>

                                    contemporary software development. Critical vulnerabilities identified in
                                    third-party/open-source components, libraries, and frameworks highlight the need for
                                    Software Composition Analysis (SCA). At the time of this writing, the primary
                                    objective of using SCA tools is to gain visibility into the open-source inventory
                                    (open-source components used in a software product) and help automate the process
                                    for open-source management. SCA tools can help with both security as well as license
                                    management.</p>

                                    designs from the early days of software to the present day. Applications may be
                                    constructed using a combination of components developed in-house and components that
                                    are developed by third parties. Components may be designed and developed by
                                    different groups using different specifications and assumptions, but for the system
                                    to function properly, these components all must interoperate properly and securely.

                                    integrate with third-party APIs. Developers now rely on Software Development Kits
                                    (SDKs) and APIs to add capabilities to their applications that otherwise would have
                                    been difficult or impossible to achieve.<br />Among the capabilities that have been
                                    made possible through integration with third parties are the following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Maps</li>

                                    are some major differences among them.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Briefly, two basic functions, GET and POST, are used to
                                    retrieve, modify, and add data from or to the server with SOAP. With REST, the state
                                    of sources is changed by making requests to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). With
                                    GraphQL, two types of requests are leveraged to query and mutate data.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">SOAP involves a large amount of data transfer with request and
                                    the response side, resulting in slowdown of communication and demand for more
                                    resources. In comparison, REST is more efficient than SOAP. GraphQL addressed the
                                    problem of over/under fetching associated with other approaches by allowing the
                                    specification of exactly what needs to be fetched.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Here, a basic distinction between different APIs has been made,
                                    and there is much more beyond what has been covered. But essentially, when selecting
                                    an API, developers need to understand and address security requirements.</p>

                                    can lead to merge conflicts, hard-to-find bugs, duplicated efforts, and other
                                    challenges. This issue may subsequently slow down the processes of software release.
