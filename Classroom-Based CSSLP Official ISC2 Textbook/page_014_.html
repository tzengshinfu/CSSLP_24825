                                    secure decommissioning. Decommissioning software may also have operating system,

                                    to comply with local, federal, or industry compliance. Governance must be addressed,
                                    and organizational policy and procedures must be established for the purpose of
                                    decommissioning software and other corresponding assets. When software is
                                    decommissioned, data may need to be retained or deleted. If retention requirements
                                    are met and data no longer needs to be maintained, it must be securely erased to
                                    address the risk of data remanence on premise or in the cloud.</p>

                                    for software development projects if they are not managed correctly. The most
                                    effective approach is to have a series of best practices that can be followed,
                                    including the following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ensure that there is an effective policy for software licensing, configuration,
                                        and credential management. Such a policy should address what software (and which
                                        versions of such software) is authorized, approved, and supported. This applies
                                        to proprietary, open source, or cloud-based software, regardless of whether it
                                        is commercial, freeware, or shareware. This policy should also articulate when
                                        obsolete software is no longer supported. Communicate the policies about license
                                        violation and penalties and educate the users.</li>
                                    <li>Develop and maintain an inventory of all authorized software through manual,
                                        automated, or a combination of manual and automated processes. Identify
                                        seldom-used licenses and any obsolete software (commercial, open source,
                                        freeware, and shareware) that is used by personnel. Develop a blacklist of
                                        software that should be prevented from installation (e.g., unauthorized
                                        software), and enforce it through processes and appropriate technologies.</li>
                                    <li>Retire old applications and decrease IT complexities. Reduce the risk of
                                        software that is no longer supported and for which security patches may not be
                                        developed.</li>
                                    <li>Collect records of all software licenses in a central repository. Include
                                        commercial, open-source, shareware, freeware, and public domain software. Use
                                        the repository to manage the purchases and support information. Run reports and
                                        match licenses to installed software.</li>

                                    data from current production systems and into specialized long-term archival storage
                                    systems. Moving inactive data out of production systems reduces infrastructure
                                    resource requirements, while reducing the potential exposure or exfiltration of
                                    data. Organizations rely on a combination of on-premises, off-site cold storage and
                                    cloud archiving services based on business needs and compliance considerations. When
                                    encrypting archived or backup files, organizations should pay equal attention to key
                                    management practices. In a worst-case scenario, bad key management could lead to the

                                    key part of data protection procedures is safely disposing of data once it is no
                                    longer needed. Failure to do so may result in data breaches and/or compliance
                                    failures. Safe disposal procedures are designed to ensure that there are no files,

                                    confidentiality. For organizations to have appropriate controls on the information
                                    they are responsible for safeguarding, they must properly safeguard used media. Rich
                                    sources of illicit information collection often include improperly sanitized
                                    electronic media.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Media can often flow in and out of organizational control in a
                                    variety of ways. Consider the insecure handling of paper in recycle bins, machines
                                    out to vendors for equipment repairs, and components hot swapped into other systems
                                    in response to hardware or software failures. These potential vulnerabilities can be
                                    mitigated through proper understanding of where information is located, what that
                                    information is and how to protect it.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The need for media sanitization should be apparent. Methods to

                                    disposal phase in the system life cycle. At the start of system development, when
                                    the initial system security plan is developed, media sanitization controls should be
                                    developed, documented and deployed. One of the key decisions that will affect the
                                    ability to conduct sanitization is choosing what media will be used within the
                                    system. This figure outlines a sanitization and disposition decision flow.</p>

                                    overwrite pass with a fixed pattern, such as binary zeros, typically hinders
                                    recovery of data, even if state-of-the-art laboratory techniques are applied to
                                    attempt a retrieval. One major drawback of relying solely upon the native read/write
                                    interface for performing the overwrite procedure is that areas not currently mapped
                                    to active logical block addressing (LBA) addresses are not dealt with. Dedicated
                                    sanitize commands support addressing these areas more effectively. The use of such
                                    commands results in a trade-off because, although they should more thoroughly
                                    address all areas of the media, using these commands also requires trust and
                                    assurance from the vendor that the commands have been implemented as expected.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Users who have become accustomed to relying on overwrite
                                    techniques on magnetic media and who have continued to apply these techniques as
                                    media types evolved (e.g., flash memory-based devices) may be exposing their data to
                                    increased risk of unintentional disclosure. Although the host interface (e.g.,
                                    Advanced Technology Attachment [ATA], Small Computer System Interface [SCSI]) may be
                                    the same or similar across devices with varying underlying media types; it is
                                    critical that the sanitization techniques be carefully matched to the media.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Destructive techniques for some media types may become more
                                    difficult or even impossible to apply in the future. Traditional techniques, such as
                                    degaussing magnetic media, become more complicated as the media evolves, because
                                    some emerging variations of magnetic recording technologies incorporate media with
                                    higher coercivity (magnetic force). As a result, existing degaussers may not have
                                    sufficient force to effectively degauss such media.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Applying destructive techniques to electronic storage media
                                    (e.g., flash memory) is also becoming more challenging as the necessary particle
                                    size for commonly applied grinding techniques goes down proportionally to any
                                    increases in flash memory storage density. Flash memory chips already present
                                    challenges. They occasionally damage grinders due to the hardness of the component
                                    materials, and this problem will get worse as grinders attempt to grind the chips
                                    into even smaller pieces.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Cryptographic erase (CE) is an emerging sanitization technique
                                    that can be used in some situations when data is encrypted as it is stored on media.
                                    With CE, media sanitization is performed by sanitizing the cryptographic keys used
                                    to encrypt the data, as opposed to sanitizing the storage locations on media
                                    containing the encrypted data itself. CE techniques are typically capable of
                                    sanitizing media quickly and could support partial sanitization, a technique where a
                                    subset of storage media is affected. Sometimes referred to as selective
                                    sanitization, partial sanitization has potential applications in cloud computing and
                                    mobile devices.</p>

                                    cases, it may be difficult to verify that CE has effectively sanitized media. If
                                    verification cannot be performed, organizations should use alternative sanitization
                                    methods that can be verified, or they should use CE in combination with a verifiable
                                    sanitization technique.</p>
