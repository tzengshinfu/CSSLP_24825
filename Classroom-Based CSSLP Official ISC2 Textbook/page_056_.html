                                    focuses on detecting pre-compilation weaknesses or post-compilation vulnerabilities
                                    in software systems. The objective of security testing is to identify and remediate
                                    issues within the SDLC before the organization suffers degradation in capabilities
                                    and continuity. From a business perspective, security test activities are often
                                    conducted to reduce overall project costs, protect brand, reduce litigation
                                    expenses, conform to regulatory requirements, or enhance the confidence of

                                    in general and should be represented in an organizational security testing strategy.
                                </p>

                                    <li>Have a balanced approach.</li>
                                    <li>Implement proper tools and techniques.</li>
                                    <li>Develop metrics to measure progress. </li>

                                <p class="comment78305">Further, comprehensive security testing should include testing
                                    of every component of a software system, not only the web interface components
                                    (e.g., web portals), but also where applicable, the mobile apps (e.g., iOS and
                                    Android versions), APIs (e.g., RESTful APIs), database components, and so on.
                                    Testing goals must identify not only those vulnerabilities that are due to insecure
                                    coding but also those that are due to flaws in design and architecture. Software
                                    security testing must ensure that software meets the security objectives of
                                    confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Third-party frameworks and libraries
                                    should also be included where applicable.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">In the case of web applications in particular, testing should
                                    include authentication, authorization, session management, data validation, logging,
                                    configuration, and cryptography, among other functions.</p>

                                    environment is to think of it as a platform that has been specifically built for
                                    executing test cases.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">A test environment should be separate and isolated from the
                                    development environment; at a minimum, it should involve hardware, software, a
                                    properly configured network, and test execution tools. Additionally, the test
                                    environment should simulate the real production environment. Configuration drifts
                                    between environments can be problematic.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Test execution tools are also known as capture/playback and
                                    capture/replay tools. The test execution tools offer scripting languages and
                                    capabilities for repeating actions, and conditional execution paths.</p>

                                    testing the nonfunctional security aspects of the software. One example in this
                                    category (where applicable) would be the testing that is conducted to ensure that
                                    software fails in a secure state, and the stack trace is not exposed in the case of
                                    encountering runtime anomalies.</p>

                                    security features of an application, system, or network. Penetration testing often
                                    involves issuing real attacks on real systems and data, using the same tools and
                                    techniques used by actual attackers. Most penetration tests involve looking for
                                    combinations of vulnerabilities on a single system or multiple systems that can be
                                    used to gain more access than could be achieved through a single vulnerability. More
                                    succinctly, OWASP defines software penetration testing as the art of testing a
                                    running application remotely to find security vulnerabilities without knowledge of
                                    the application inner workings. Regardless of definition, penetration testing
                                    involves simulating attacks to uncover vulnerabilities.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Typically, a penetration test team can access an application as
                                    if they were users. Testers act as though they are attackers and attempt to identify
                                    and exploit vulnerabilities. In many cases, testers may also receive standard or
                                    administrator user accounts as well. Penetration tests, like other test methods,
                                    frequently involve a combination of manual testing techniques and specialized
                                    automated penetration testing tools.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The objective of penetration testing is to observe whether the
                                    software resists or tolerates the attacks and how it behaves when it cannot do so.
                                    Penetration testing pays particular attention to those aspects of software behavior,
                                    interactions, and vulnerabilities that cannot be observed using other test
                                    techniques during the software’s development, integration, and staging for

                                    <li><em>Planning. </em>In the planning phase, the senior management of the
                                        organization and the penetration testers will identify rules of engagement
                                        (approval to begin test, test windows) and set testing goals. Then, management
                                        approval is finalized and documented. The planning phase sets the groundwork for
                                        a successful penetration test. No actual testing occurs in this phase.</li>
                                    <li><em>Discovery. </em>The discovery phase is the start of actual testing and
                                        covers information gathering and scanning. Network port and service
                                        identification is conducted to identify potential targets. Other techniques are
                                        used to gather information on host name, IP address, system information, and
                                        application and service information. In some cases, techniques such as physical
                                        walk-throughs of facilities and examination of trash bins may be used to collect
                                        additional information on the targeted network. These efforts may also uncover
                                        additional information to be used during the penetration tests, such as
                                        passwords written on paper.</li>
                                    <li><em>Vulnerability Mapping. </em>Vulnerability mapping involves comparing the
                                        services, applications, and operating systems of scanned hosts against
                                        vulnerability databases, as well as the testers’ own knowledge of
                                        vulnerabilities.</li>
                                    <li><em>Attack. </em>Executing an attack is at the heart of any penetration test. It
                                        is the process of verifying previously identified potential vulnerabilities by
                                        attempting to exploit them. If an attack is successful, the vulnerability is
                                        verified, and safeguards are identified to mitigate the associated security
                                        exposure. If an attack is unsuccessful, the tester should attempt to exploit
                                        another discovered vulnerability. A successful attack equates to verification of
                                        a vulnerability. An unsuccessful attack does not mean that the vulnerability is
                                        not exploitable.</li>
                                    <li><em>Reporting. </em>The reporting phase occurs simultaneously with the other
                                        phases of the penetration test. In the planning phase, the assessment plan is
                                        developed, along with rules of engagement. A report has various sections,
                                        including an executive summary, summary and/or details of identified
                                        vulnerabilities, attack scenarios and results, and mitigation recommendations.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p class="comment78305">In the discovery and attack phases, written logs are usually
                                    kept, and periodic reports are made to system administrators and/or management. At
                                    the conclusion of the test, a report is compiled to describe identified
                                    vulnerabilities, present a risk rating, and give guidance on how to mitigate the
                                    discovered weaknesses.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Penetration testing often includes nontechnical methods of
                                    attack as well. For example, a penetration tester could breach physical security
                                    controls and procedures to connect to a network, steal equipment, capture sensitive
                                    information (possibly by installing keylogging devices), or disrupt communications.
                                    Exercise caution when performing physical security testing. Security guards should
                                    be made aware of how to verify the validity of tester activity, such as via a point
                                    of contact or documentation. Another nontechnical means of attack is the use of
                                    social engineering, such as posing as a help desk agent and calling to request a
                                    user’s passwords, or calling the help desk posing as a user and asking for a
                                    password to be reset.</p>

                                            class="rendered">fuzz testing</button>) </strong>is a black box testing
                                    technique. It is done through automated means (e.g., using fuzz tools) and is
                                    intended to find implementation bugs by injecting malformed/semi-malformed data.
                                    NIST relates fuzz testing to fault injection in that invalid data is input into the
                                    application via the environment, or input by one process into another process. Fuzz
                                    testing is implemented by tools commonly referred to as “fuzzers,” which are
                                    programs or scripts that submit some combination of inputs to the test target to see
                                    how it responds.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The attack vector is the I/O of the system being fuzzed and may
                                    include the user interface, command line, import/export capabilities, URLs, forms,
                                    etc. Fuzzing programs fall into two different categories:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Generation-based. </em>In generation-based fuzzing, there is an
                                        understanding of the file format or protocol. Generation-based fuzzing involves
                                        “generating” the fuzz inputs from scratch based on the specification or format.
                                        This type of fuzzing is also known as “smart” or “intelligent” fuzzing.</li>
                                    <li><em>Mutation-based. </em>In mutation-based fuzzing, injecting the fault values
                                        is done blindly. Hence, it is also known as “dumb” fuzzing, as in lacking
                                        understanding of the format or structure of the data. One example can be just
                                        replacing or appending a random section of data.</li>

                                    uncovering types of vulnerability. However, the two main challenges with fuzzing are
                                    setup and data analysis. Fuzzing tends to require special setup to include a testing
                                    harness. Fuzz testing is noisy and produces large amounts of data, which often

                                    quantify an organization's exposure to surface vulnerabilities. A surface
                                    vulnerability is a weakness that exists in isolation, independent from other
                                    vulnerabilities. The system’s behaviors and outputs in response to attack patterns
                                    submitted by the scanner are compared against those that characterize the signatures
                                    of known vulnerabilities, and the tool reports any matches that are found.</p>

                                    and common vulnerabilities that typically elude signature-based scans.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Many vulnerabilities detected by signature-based scanners may be
                                    located in sections of code that are unused, or dead. The removal of dead code
                                    before compiling the application will often significantly reduce the number of
                                    vulnerabilities that would otherwise be found through automated vulnerability
                                    scanning. However, it can be very challenging to locate dead code in third-party

                                    For example, it may be done to inspect traffic for either malicious threats or
                                    confidential data leakage. What we mean by confidential data leakage is data an
                                    employee should not be sending out, such as a company’s financial statement.
                                    Encrypted traffic presents a challenge in this regard.</p>

                                    sequences. The NIST Test Suite is a statistical package consisting of 15 tests that
                                    were developed to test the randomness of (arbitrarily long) binary sequences
                                    produced by either hardware- or software-based cryptographic random or pseudorandom
                                    number generators.</p>

                                        proportion of zeroes and ones for the entire sequence. The purpose of this test
                                        is to determine whether the number of ones and zeroes in a sequence are
                                        approximately the same as would be expected for a truly random sequence. The
                                        test assesses the closeness of the fraction of ones to ½, that is, the number of
                                        ones and zeroes in a sequence should be about the same. All subsequent tests

                                    unpredictable. Entropy is the amount of uncertainty that an attacker must face to
                                    determine the value of a secret. It is difficult to create sources of entropy for
                                    random bit generators; true randomization is challenging because we generally fall
                                    into creating patterns even if we try not to.</p>

                                        have trouble producing good randomness, especially IoT-class devices that have

                                        communications. The best sources of true randomness are based on unpredictable

                                    can trace between the executing code and the instrumented source code to observe the
                                    software’s behavior and state changes when execution reaches each instrumented code
                                    portion. In this way, the tester can observe and even quantify the secure and
                                    insecure state changes that result from the instrumented faults, as well as the ways
                                    in which such faults propagate throughout the program (as traced through its source
                                    code).</p>

                                    calls. When new attack patterns and intrusion techniques emerge, the source code can
                                    be re-instrumented with representative faults. Note that while source code fault
                                    injection achieves greater code coverage and a lower false positive rate than other
                                    testing methods, it also requires a deeper understanding of the software that is

                                    point—and observing the results. Stress testing can help ensure that software
                                    exhibits correct behavior under stressful conditions. Although it is true that large

                                    software, stress testing should not be confused with volume testing or load testing.
                                    The basic differences between these three forms of testing are summarized below:</p>

                                            class="rendered">Unit testing</button> </strong>is about developers testing
                                    small units of code (i.e., often functions and methods) in isolation using stubs and
                                    drivers to address dependencies of the unit of code being tested. Unit testing
                                    focuses on the input, processing, and output of a software unit which typically
                                    references function or method testing.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Unit tests ensure that individual pieces or objects are
                                    functioning correctly by supplying a specific set of inputs and known outputs which
                                    are measured against the actual values returned. Unit testing ensures that new
                                    development performs required functions and prevents regressions during sustainment.
                                    Since unit testing detects issues before being committed to a repository, the cost
                                    of fixes is typically reduced, and debugging is simplified.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Test cases must be created to provide adequate code coverage –
                                    that is, the percentage of the code covered by tests. Even with complete code
                                    coverage, there is no guarantee that the code is free of defects, as there may be
                                    bugs that are not identified by the existing test cases. There is also the concept
                                    of positive and negative unit testing code. Positive cases test for functional
                                    correctness. Negative cases expect failure and ensure that functions fail and handle
                                    errors correctly.</p>
