                                <p class="comment78305">Various software development methodologies have been introduced
                                    over the years to meet the evolving needs of businesses. Organizations that engage
                                    in software development adopt methodologies based on business objectives. Regardless
                                    of methodology (e.g., Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, etc.), organizations must
                                    incorporate security practices into system and software development processes.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Compliance adds further complications, as most organizations are
                                    subject to a combination of industry-specific, state, national, or international
                                    regulations, laws, standards, or contractual obligations. NIST, ISO, <strong><button
                                            data-definition title="IEEE is an international professional organization that sets standards for telecommunications, computer engineering and similar disciplines"
                                            class="rendered">IEEE</button>, </strong>and PCI standards are just a few
                                    among myriad possible examples. Most standards take a life cycle approach to the
                                    management of information security in general, and software security in the
                                    specific.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Compliance can be seen as an organizational risk. Risk
                                    management is a comprehensive process that requires organizations to scope, assess,
                                    mitigate, and monitor risks that can encompass everything from compliance to
                                    employees to something technical like a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). Risk
                                    management is a continuous and iterative process that is best executed when secure
                                    software life-cycle management has the same characteristics—continuous and
                                    iterative.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Enabling security and managing software risks involves adequate
                                    configuration management. Establishing effective configuration management requires
                                    planning, change management, and monitoring. Secure configuration of a system
                                    requires using secure configuration baselines and guidance on best practices.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Security-relevant documentation is created throughout the life
                                    cycle, usually at each security milestone. This documentation can provide insight
                                    into the software development and security practices of a software supplier
                                    organization. This insight is especially valuable for software that is acquired, or
                                    whose development has been outsourced to increase the receiving organization’s
                                    confidence that the software is trustworthy.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Eventually, software will reach the end of its life cycle and be
                                    decommissioned. Decommissioning, often referred to as “sunsetting,” should be a
                                    guided and consistent process established through organizational policies and
                                    procedures. Decommissioning software may also involve secure decommissioning and
                                    removal of the data stored and processed by the software and host hardware.</p>

                                    (SDLC) processes are recommended, regardless of which software development process
                                    is adopted by an organization. The Open Worldwide Application Security Project’s

                                <p class="comment78305">Many factors determine an organization’s secure software
                                    life-cycle management. At an enterprise level, organizational risk tolerance will
                                    play a role in determining funding and focus for security within software
                                    development teams. On a more micro level, software development team culture and
                                    individual contributor experiences with security are examples that may shape the
                                    implementation of security with respect to software development.</p>
