                                    As part of the onboarding process and during the life cycle of a contract, suppliers
                                    are often required to show that they meet the required level of information security

                                <p class="comment78305">When organizations acquire commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
                                    software, their primary considerations tend to be cost and features: Will this
                                    software do what is needed, and is it affordable? Other attributes such as
                                    scalability and performance may figure in the decision. Security is typically an
                                    afterthought, and as a result many organizations purchase systems that are more
                                    vulnerable than they should be. </p>
                                <p class="comment78305">This outcome can be avoided by making security a higher priority
                                    in the decision-making process. Specifically, organizations should begin by
                                    identifying their own security requirements and principles. This would enable them
                                    to specify and prioritize security features among other attributes of the COTS
                                    products they are considering. They should also have a process for incorporating
                                    security engineering into the system as a COTS product is adopted and deployed in
                                    the organization.</p>

                                    scale is critical when appropriately managing the relationship with that vendor or
                                    supplier. Strategic suppliers are deemed to be mission critical and cannot be easily
                                    replaced if they become unavailable.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Although you will typically do business with only a few of these
                                    types of partners, they are the most crucial. Commodity suppliers, on the other
                                    hand, provide goods and services that can easily be replaced and sourced from a
                                    variety of suppliers if necessary. Tactical suppliers supplement strategic and
                                    commodity suppliers to manage emerging unforeseen issues and incidents. This figure

                                    vendors and suppliers. They may require audit of the security policy and the due
                                    diligence to ensure compliance with the policy. This audit and due diligence may be
                                    conducted in early stages of evaluating suppliers/vendors and subsequently on an
                                    ongoing basis (e.g., annually) as part of the review and monitoring of third
                                    parties.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Managing a successful audit has three main areas of focus:</p>

                                    <li>Establishing a security baseline through annual audits</li>

                                <p class="comment78305">It is important to understand the scope of the audit, as it may
                                    be narrow or wide. The objectives of an audit must be clearly expressed and will
                                    ultimately determine its scope. An audit may be focused on documented policies and
                                    procedures, or it may include the direct testing of the security controls.
                                    Organizations may measure their progress against the baselines established from
                                    previous assessments and audits.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Examples of common and relevant audits include ISO 27001 audits;
                                    SOC 2, Type 2 audits; and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
                                    compliance audits. Assessments and audits are typically done at a regular frequency
                                    (e.g., annually) and conducted by independent, qualified third parties.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Assessments and audits may be done in terms of snapshots (points
                                    in time) or over a period of time. Regardless of the audit type, given that security
                                    policies are foundational to every information security program, the audit of
                                    security policies should be expected.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Software quality assurance audits are intended to improve the
                                    quality of software and may include examination of code, processes, and test data.
                                    Software compliance audits may be conducted to measure the degree of compliance with
                                    mandates posed by regulations and standards. Software licensing audits may be
                                    conducted as part of the asset management or risk management practices.</p>

                                    collect information about the IT environment from many disparate sources to better
                                    examine the overall security of the organization and streamline security efforts.
                                    These tools are generally known as SIEM solutions.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">There is no formal industry standard that defines what a SIEM is
                                    or the functions that they perform. SIEM is a marketing term, used by vendors to
                                    label products and services that offer a range of capabilities for organizations
                                    looking to integrate the many different sources of security-oriented information
                                    throughout their systems. Many different products offer these services, or
                                    similar-sounding sets of services, under a variety of names and acronyms such as
                                    “SEM” or “SIM.” You will need to closely read the fine print to separate the SIEM
                                    (or SEIM) required from the ones on offer in the marketplace.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">As these shorter acronyms suggest, a security event manager
                                    (SEM) provides real-time monitoring of events by correlating and analyzing data from
                                    different security sensors in the system. Security information managers (SIMs)
                                    provide long-term storage and management of such event data. SIMs were traditionally
                                    used for nonreal time investigation and analysis, while SEMs were part of the
                                    real-time incident detection and response process.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The general idea of a SIEM solution is to gather log data from
                                    various sources across the enterprise to better understand potential security
                                    concerns and apportion resources accordingly. Some common functions of SIEM
                                    solutions include the following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Aggregation. </em>The SIEM tool gathers information from across the
                                        environment. This offers a centralized repository of security data and allows
                                        analysts to have a single interface with which to perform their duties. The SIEM
                                        might gather log data from:<ul>
                                            <li>Firewalls</li>
                                            <li>IDS/IPS systems</li>
                                            <li>IT performance monitoring tools</li>

                                    <li><em>Normalization. </em>SIEM tools can often collect different types of
                                        information from different types of sources and present the data in a
                                        meaningful, standardized way, such that the analysis task is simplified;
                                        analysts can use the SIEM tool instead of repeating various log review actions
                                        on multiple systems.</li>
                                    <li><em>Correlation. </em>The SIEM may be able to mathematically assign weight and
                                        probability to various activities throughout the enterprise as a means of
                                        automatically calculating the probability that a given stream of log information
                                        is an actual attack, whether the attack affects more than host/location/network,
                                        and the likelihood and significance of input.</li>
                                    <li><em>Secure storage. </em>Because log data is enormously valuable (both to the
                                        organization and to attackers) for many reasons and purposes, SIEM tools often
                                        offer the ability to archive the material they contain in a secure manner.</li>
                                    <li><em>Analysis. </em>Some SIEM solutions perform automated analyses, using scripts
                                        and heuristics<strong>.</strong></li>
                                    <li><em>Reporting. </em>SIEM solutions often offer reporting tools for distilling
                                        current and historical depictions of the activity in your environment.</li>
                                    <li><em>Real-Time Monitoring. </em>SIEM provides real-time monitoring and threat
                                        detection across the organization’s infrastructure, which can enable rapid
                                        responses to potential data breaches.</li>

                                    considered corrective, whereas modifying and updating the software to keep it
                                    relevant are adaptive activities. Perfecting refers to maintenance activities
                                    undertaken to keep the system functioning properly in the long term, and preventive
                                    activities are intended to keep bugs and glitches from occurring in the future.</p>

                                        by the parent GLP license, such as a non-disclosure agreement or contract. The

                                <p class="comment78305">Software supply-chain considerations vary based on the license
                                    type of software, such as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf
                                    (GOTS), and open-source software (OSS). Situations may vary even within the
                                    above-mentioned licensing types. The example of OSS is detailed below.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">OSS is software with the source code available to the public.
                                    OSS has two main inferred licensing conditions: namely, permissive and copyleft.
                                    Both have a similar cost structure with no cost associated with usage. A permissive
                                    software license includes free use with minimal requirements dictating
                                    redistribution. However, copyleft software license is also free use and
                                    reproduction, but on the condition that the source code and derivative software
                                    products remain publicly available. The small difference may have a large negative
                                    impact on an organization that modifies copyleft OSS code and erroneously hopes to
                                    keep the derivative product confidential. Alternatively, if a derivative copyleft
                                    source is procured from a supplier, the source could potentially be requested. </p>

                                    and policies of its supporting vendors. The right to audit is a key control that can
                                    be included in a vendor contract.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Including a right-to-audit clause in a contract does not mean
                                    the organization must perform an audit; it merely reserves the right to perform an
                                    audit if needed.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Right to audit is not solely for high-risk relationships; a
                                    low-risk proposition can quickly turn into a high-risk one as the nature of the
                                    relationship changes and a vendor starts offering different types of services for
                                    the organization.</p>

                                    or auditing a supply chain. Contractual obligations between acquisitions and
                                    suppliers will determine responsibility for compliance and security. Contractual
                                    agreements will also determine a supplier’s responsibility to provide security
                                    artifacts such as SBOM documentation. Additionally, explicit contract language can
                                    also empower an organization to audit suppliers for security compliance.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">With most cloud providers, there is a concept of shared
                                    responsibility. A shared model can lower the operational security burden for cloud
                                    service providers (CSP) and customers. Security practitioners should carefully
                                    review the cloud services selected by an organization to understand services, IT
                                    integration, and compliance. In a shared responsibility model, security
                                    practitioners need to understand the dividing line between vendor inherited
                                    security, shared security, and customer security considerations. </p>
