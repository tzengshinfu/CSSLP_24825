                                    secure coding standards. Various guidelines and checklists for secure coding
                                    practices have been developed and published. In addition to security considerations,
                                    coding standards ensure code uniformity and maintainability, which also supports
                                    security throughout a software system's life cycle.</p>

                                    to secure software development. Coding standards encourage programmers to follow a
                                    uniform set of rules and guidelines determined by the requirements of the project
                                    and organization, not by the programmer’s familiarity or preference. Once
                                    established, these standards can be used as a metric to evaluate source code (using
                                    manual or automated processes) for compliance with the standard.<sup>1</sup></p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Today there are a plethora of secure coding standards and
                                    practices originating from many organizations including industry giants,
                                    international standards groups, and nonprofits. One example is the Carnegie Mellon
                                    University (CMU) Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Computer Emergency Response
                                    Team (CERT), which publishes guidance for secure coding best practices. SEI CERT
                                    also publishes generic Top 10 Secure Coding Practices guidance, enumerated below.

                                    both declarative and imperative security (e.g., .NET, J2EE). Declarative security
                                    specifies application security using configuration or annotation. An example of
                                    declarative, or “external,” includes J2EE security descriptors that include
                                    considerations for access control and authentication. Changes to declarative
                                    security do not require software development efforts. The hosted instance of the
                                    application server typically handles security enforcement.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Alternatively, programmatic security refers to security
                                    integrated into application code. Programmatic security may supplement when
                                    declarative mechanisms alone are not adequate for application business needs.
                                    Programmatic security is more difficult to change since it is embedded in an
                                    application. This level of integration and inflexibility also bolsters security
                                    configuration integrity.</p>

                                    variant CWE-572—Call to Thread run() instead of start(). Typically, a call to a
                                    thread object run() method is a programming error. The developer that erroneously
                                    executes this most certainly intended to start a new thread but instead caused a
                                    defect calling run() instead of start(). When this occurs, run() will execute in the

                                    resources with improper synchronization are known as “race conditions.”</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The program contains a code sequence that can run concurrently
                                    with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a
                                    shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be
                                    modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently. This architecture
                                    can have security implications when the expected synchronization is in
                                    security-critical code, such as recording whether a user is authenticated or
                                    modifying important state information that should not be influenced by an outsider.
                                    A race condition violates the following closely related properties:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Exclusivity. </em>The code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared
                                        resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared
                                        resource before the original sequence has completed execution.</li>
                                    <li><em>Atomicity. </em>The code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other
                                        thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or
                                        a subset) against the same resource.<sup>3</sup></li>

                                    commonly known as Time-of-Check/Time-of-Use (TOC/TOU) or race condition attacks.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">A TOCTOU (time-of-check, time-of-use) race condition is possible
                                    when two or more concurrent processes are operating on a shared file system.
                                    Typically, the first access is a check to verify some attribute of the file,
                                    followed by a call to use the file. An attacker can alter the file between the two
                                    accesses or replace the file with a symbolic or hard link to a different file. These
                                    TOCTOU conditions can be exploited when a program performs two or more file
                                    operations on the same file name or path name. A program that performs two or more
                                    file operations on a single file name or path name creates a race window between the
                                    two file operations. This race window comes from the assumption that the file name
                                    or path name refers to the same resource both times. If an attacker can modify the
                                    file, remove it, or replace it with a different file, then this assumption will not
                                    hold.<sup>4</sup></p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Race windows. </em>Elimination of race conditions begins with identifying
                                        race windows. A race window is a code segment that accesses the race object in a
                                        way that opens a window of opportunity during which other concurrent flows could
                                        “race in” and alter the race object.</li>
                                    <li><em>Mutual exclusion (Mutex). </em>Race conditions are eliminated by making
                                        conflicting race windows mutually exclusive. Once a potential race window begins
                                        execution, no conflicting race window can be allowed to execute until the first
                                        race window has completed. Race windows are referred to as critical sections
                                        because it is critical that the two conflicting race windows don’t overlap
                                        execution. Treating each critical section as an atomic unit with respect to
                                        conflicting race windows is called mutual exclusion.</li>

                                <p class="comment78305">Input validation is one of the most fundamental and most
                                    critical mitigation strategies relevant to most common web application
                                    vulnerabilities (e.g., injection vulnerability, buffer overflow vulnerability).
                                    Input validation represents protection at the perimeters of an application and
                                    should be considered a key layer of defense in a defense-in-depth strategy. Often
                                    input validation is associated with user interfaces but software security
                                    practitioners understand that integration points between software systems where data
                                    flows between systems should also be restricted and validated.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">An important question to answer when developing secure code is
                                    to determine where to perform input validation. It is recommended that input
                                    validation be performed both on the server side (backend) as well as on the client
                                    side (frontend). At a bare minimum, input validation must be performed on the
                                    backend. It should never be performed only on the client side (frontend).
                                    Client-side validation should be used only from a user experience standpoint and
                                    never for implementing security in your software. Client-side validation can be
                                    easily bypassed; for this reason, it must never be trusted to provide adequate
                                    levels of security.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Software, especially internet-centric, adheres to Postel’s Law:
                                    “Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.” Liberal
                                    acceptance of inputs increases user and technology interoperability at the expense
                                    of increased cyber-attack surfaces. This architectural idea has resulted in the
                                    interconnectivity of the internet today. Security practitioners should take a
                                    slightly different stance than Postel to ensure business continuity is maintained
                                    and software risks are managed. A simple stance for defensively architecting
                                    applications might include:</p>

                                    <li>All input data is evil and must be sanitized.</li>
                                    <li>Data must be accepted for interoperability but there is no trust without
                                        verification.</li>

                                <p class="comment78305">Filtering is a form of validation. There are often known good
                                    inputs (i.e., inputs the developer is completely certain are safe). There are also
                                    known bad characters (i.e., inputs the developer is certain are unsafe). Based on
                                    this, there are two approaches to managing input:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Allow list. </em>An allow list, formerly called a whitelist, is a list of
                                        “known good inputs.” It is basically a list that says, “A, B, and C are good
                                        (and everything else is bad).” This is a good practice to prevent malicious
                                        input into the application.</li>
                                    <li><em>Block list. </em>A block list, formerly called a blacklist, is a list of
                                        “known bad inputs.” It is basically a list that says, “A, B, and C are bad (and
                                        everything else is good).” </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="comment78305">Deny-list validation should be avoided in most cases, as it
                                    could be relatively trivial for an attacker to bypass such filters. For input fields
                                    provided by a user, allow-list validation is appropriate.</p>

                                    of a name. Equivalent forms of a name resolve to a same standard name (canonical
                                    name). When determining requirements for secure software code, it is important to
                                    identify the alternate representations and design the software so that the
                                    validation decisions are not based upon any one method of a file or device name.
                                    Regardless of the development platform, always transform the file name or Uniform

                                    commands sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead. Output
                                    sanitization means sanitizing the data you may already have and securing it prior to
                                    rendering it for the end user. This is done by converting untrusted input into a
                                    safe form where the input is displayed as data to the user without executing as
                                    code. Output sanitization is also known as output encoding.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">One way of performing output encoding is to use an Extensible
                                    Stylesheet Language (XSL) engine, which can convert the output to a different
                                    encoding. When the document is loaded into memory, XML applications such as XSL
                                    Transformation (XSLT) engines convert it to Unicode. The XSL engine then uses the
                                    stylesheet templates to create a transformed version of the content in memory
                                    structures. When it is done, it serializes the internal content into a stream of
                                    bytes that it feeds to the outside world. During the serialization process, it can
                                    convert the internal Unicode to some other encoding for the output.</p>

                                    uses an encoded input, but the data does not match what was intended. For example,
                                    HTML supports entity encoding for HTML body elements on a website. A programmer may
                                    encode output as an attribute that contains functional JavaScript. The following
                                    HTML example focuses on the web-based software, but this weakness applies to any
                                    software data flows that support multiple encodings.</p>

                                    of software. Proper error and exception handling must resolve anomalies, faults, and
                                    errors in ways that do not leave the software, its resources, data, or environment
                                    in a vulnerable state. All exceptions must be explicitly handled. Best practices
                                    have been developed for various programming environments. A few examples of commonly
                                    agreed-upon best practices in this regard include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Not ignoring exceptions</li>
                                    <li>Leaning toward catching specific exceptions</li>
                                    <li>Having a catch-all exception block</li>
                                    <li>Cleaning up resources in a final block</li>
                                </ul>

                                    messages are one source of information leakage about the software, including the
                                    logic of the code or schema of the database. Leaked information may be used for
                                    launching focused attacks (e.g., SQL Injection). Verbose error messages should be
                                    avoided, and generic responses must be returned.</p>

Examples include audits of security controls, configuration baselines, and financial records. 2) Independent review and examination of records and activities to assess the adequacy of system controls, to ensure compliance with established policies and operational procedures.

                                    ensure compliance with established policies and operational procedures. Logging
                                    describes who, what, when, where, and how to capture information to be reviewed at a
                                    later date. Auditing describes who, what, when, where, and how to review the
                                    captured log data.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Log files in general can show discrete events within an
                                    application or system, such as those that pertain to failure, error, or state
                                    transformation. It is important to recognize that logs are not meant to solely serve
                                    the purpose of troubleshooting software by developers and that there may be many
                                    stakeholders interested in events and logs, including security personnel and
                                    auditors.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The types of information contained in each log will depend on
                                    the nature of the log in question. Establishing audit trails requires, at minimum,
                                    the capture of “who,” “what,” “when,” and “where” in logs. When capturing the time
                                    (“when”), use a consistent timestamp.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Audit trails need to capture enough evidence to help in an
                                    investigative process. Among the factors should be when the event took place, who
                                    caused the event (e.g., user ID), what triggered the event (e.g., program, command),
                                    and date and time, which will help determine whether the user was who they should
                                    have been or a masquerading intruder.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Security practitioners must also be concerned with maintaining
                                    logs while considering confidentiality and integrity concerns. To maintain
                                    integrity, logs hashes may be implemented, or logs may be stored on write once, read
                                    many (WORM) drives where, as the name suggests, data written to the medium cannot be
                                    erased or modified. From a confidentiality perspective, log access should be limited
                                    based on need-to-know. Sometimes logs may contain sensitive data to which an auditor
                                    should not have undue access. In this case, user data could be sanitized or masked
                                    before storage for compliance considerations.</p>

                                    as .NET, PHP, and Java (among others) offer built-in session management
                                    capabilities. The built-in approach is preferred over custom (developed in-house)
                                    session management implementations, but even these frameworks may not be free of

                                    application programming interfaces (APIs). Think of them as a set of interfaces
                                    where software services can be requested. Examples of APIs include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>APIs from the standard library of a programming language</li>
                                    <li>APIs from third-party libraries to perform cryptographic operations</li>
                                    <li>APIs to access and process data in a database</li>
                                    <li>APIs available through the operating system for kernel services</li>
                                    <li>Web APIs to receive real-time traffic information from some provider</li>
                                    <li>APIs to send a message or receive a message securely</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="comment78305">In summary, APIs are used to communicate with other software
                                    layers, products, and services.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Libraries provide the implementations in terms of functions and
                                    procedures, and for the API users, they are a set of specifications for invocation
                                    without the knowledge of how the APIs are implemented. Of special importance to the
                                    CSSLP is the safety and security of these APIs.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Software developers must make efforts to avoid using unsafe
                                    APIs. One example of unsafe APIs is the various string manipulation functions from
                                    the standard library of C/C++, where the improper usage of these functions could
                                    result in buffer overflows. Most static analyzers can detect the usage of unsafe
                                    APIs.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Security of APIs in general, and web APIs specifically, must be
                                    assured, whether you own them or you use them. A discussion of the security of web
                                    APIs is outside the scope of this domain; however, note that the same security
                                    principles that have been discussed so far (e.g., least privilege, separation of
                                    concerns, defense in depth) are relevant to the security of web services.</p>

                                <p class="comment78305">Type safety refers to the ability of a programming language to
                                    prevent type errors. A type error is incorrect or undesirable program behavior
                                    caused by a discrepancy between different data types and includes considerations for
                                    constants, variables, methods, and functions. Type enforcement can be static,
                                    catching potential errors at compile time; dynamic, associating type information
                                    with values at runtime, and consulting them as needed to detect imminent errors, or
                                    a combination of both.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The behaviors classified as type errors by a given programming
                                    language are usually those that result from attempts to perform operations on values
                                    that are not of the appropriate data type.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">From a security perspective, type safety is desirable. C and C++
                                    are type unsafe, whereas other languages, such as .NET, Ada, and Java, are
                                    considered type safe. There are also special-purpose programming languages like Ada,
                                    designed to be type and memory safe to support the development of critical software
                                    systems such as embedded systems on aircraft. Software security practitioners should
                                    understand the tradeoffs between commonly adopted languages and special case
                                    languages. For instance, Ada is more compliant with the requirements for critical
                                    infrastructure than C++ by default but where will you find competent Ada
                                    programmers? At the time of this writing there are millions of C++ developers
                                    compared to a much smaller unknown quantity utilizing Ada.</p>

                                    computer system. Improper memory management practices can lead to serious stability
                                    and security-relevant issues. Memory leaks associated mostly with unmanaged
                                    programming environments (e.g., C/C++) are common, yet not easy to trace back to the
                                    source of the problem to fix.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Depending on the nature of the problem, memory leaks may be
                                    negligible with little (if any) noticeable effect, or significant enough that they
                                    lead to an eventual exhaustion of the resource and abnormal system behavior. Leaks
                                    associated with kernel processes can be particularly problematic and may result in
                                    significant stability issues and deterioration of system performance.</p>

                                    Garbage collection facilitates the destruction of instantiated dangling objects in
                                    memory that have gone out of scope but are not explicitly destroyed (closed), at the
                                    cost of a small amount of overhead. This tradeoff frees developers from various

                                    substitute (i.e., token) that retains data without compromising its security.
                                    Tokenization focuses on minimizing data storage for essential information that
                                    positively impacts data security, especially for credit card transactions.
                                    Tokenization also aids in compliance with PCI-DSS and other applicable government
                                    considerations. The figure below demonstrates how tokenization might abstract credit
                                    card information during a transaction.</p>

                                    irreversible tokens within the payment card industry. Irreversible tokens cannot be
                                    converted back to the original payment information. Reversible tokens afford the
                                    ability to convert the token back into payment information. Continuing the example
                                    of tokens in the payment card industry, PCI describes four security domains that
                                    include token generation, token mapping, card data vaulting, and key management. The

                                    security benefits that come with it. Technologies may be used to create an isolated
                                    and safe execution environment, and to contain the possible damage and impact of
                                    misbehaving code.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">A sandbox typically provides a tightly controlled set of
                                    resources for guest programs to run in, such as scratch space on disk and memory.
                                    Network access and the ability to inspect the host system or read from input devices
                                    are usually disallowed or heavily restricted. A Java applet run in a browser is an

                                <p class="comment78305">The concept of separation kernel was first introduced by John
                                    Rushby in his paper titled “Design and Verification of Secure Systems.”</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Rushby’s central idea was that from a security perspective,
                                    separation (e.g., the function implemented by a hypervisor to separate virtual
                                    machines) is such a critical operation that it should not be handled by a
                                    large/complex operating system that has a multiplicity of responsibilities.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">A separation kernel, solely focused on the separation task, is
                                    created by factoring out the separation function from the operating system,
                                    resulting in a kernel that can be verified for correctness due to its simplicity.
                                </p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Initial use case for separation kernel was its application to
                                    high-security systems responsible for the separation of Department of Defense and
                                    government top-secret, secret, and confidential information classifications.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">A separation kernel is a special type of bare metal hypervisor
                                    that only does separation. More specifically, it is a tiny piece of carefully
                                    crafted code (as small as 15KB) that utilizes modern hardware virtualization
                                    features to 1) define fixed virtual machines (VMs) and 2) control information
                                    flows.<sup>6</sup></p>
                                <p class="comment78305">A minimal implementation of a separation kernel involves
                                    eliminating as many things as possible (e.g., device drivers, user model, shell
                                    access). Any such kernel architecture, although not best suited for desktop use, may
                                    be appropriate for embedded real-time or safety-critical systems.</p>

                                    developed through a combined effort of six countries: the United States, Canada,
                                    France, Germany, The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. This effort built on
                                    earlier standards, including Europe’s Information Technology Security Evaluation
                                    Criteria (ITSEC), the United States’ Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria
                                    (TCSEC), and the Canadian Trusted Computer Product Evaluation Criteria (CTCPEC).
                                    This international standard for computer security allows an objective evaluation to
                                    validate that a product satisfies a defined set of security requirements.</p>

                                    transmitting data in a form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and
                                    process it. Cryptography is most often associated with scrambling plaintext into
                                    cipher text through the process of encryption and the reverse: unscrambling from
                                    cipher text back to plaintext through the process of decryption.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Modern cryptography concerns itself with the following
                                    objectives:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Confidentiality (the information cannot be understood by anyone for whom it was
                                        not intended)</li>
                                    <li>Integrity (the information cannot be altered in storage or transit between
                                        sender and intended receiver without the alteration being detected)</li>
                                    <li>Nonrepudiation (the creator/sender of the information cannot deny at a later
                                        stage their intentions in the creation or transmission of the information)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="comment78305">Understand that symmetric algorithms may only be used to address
                                    the confidentiality requirement, whereas asymmetric algorithms have other use cases
                                    as well. Further, application developers must ensure that they are using the latest
                                    standards (e.g., TLS 1.2 and AES 256 are current as of this writing), as they are
                                    subject to change. The word standard implies the usage of vetted solutions and
                                    avoidance of custom cryptography where and when possible. Note that encryption may
                                    be considered a dual-use good (having both commercial and military applications),
                                    and that it may be subject to export restrictions, depending upon certain criteria.

                                <p class="comment78305">The terms encryption and cryptography are often used
                                    interchangeably, but a distinction must be made between them. If cryptography is a
                                    science, then encryption refers to one component of that science. Remember the
                                    basics of how symmetric and asymmetric algorithms work. Below is a refresher
                                    summary:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Symmetric algorithms are relatively fast (as compared to asymmetric ones) and
                                        require a smaller resource investment, but present key management challenges, as
                                        the same key that is used to encrypt a message will also be needed to decrypt
                                        it. This key must remain private and in possession <em>only </em>of the parties
                                        involved. Good examples of symmetric algorithms include DES (which is considered
                                        broken) and AES (standard at the time of this writing).</li>
                                    <li>Asymmetric algorithms rely on a pair of keys: one that is private (known only to
                                        the owner) and one that is public (assumed that everyone could have knowledge of
                                        it). To achieve confidentiality, a message is encrypted using the public key of
                                        the recipient, so that only the recipient can decrypt the message. Good examples
                                        of asymmetric algorithms include Diffie-Hellman (for historical reasons) and RSA
                                        (current). Public key cryptography relies on the Public Key Infrastructure
                                        (PKI), which consists of several components including Certificate Authority
                                        (CA), Registration Authority (RA) and digital certificates.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="comment78305">A more practical usage would involve a hybrid of symmetric and
                                    asymmetric algorithms. In such a hybrid usage, a symmetric algorithm is used to
                                    encrypt the message, and the key used to perform the encryption is asymmetrically
                                    exchanged with the other party.</p>

                                    protection afforded by technologies such as TLS. Protection against unauthorized
                                    disclosure during the transmission of sensitive data between endpoints may require
                                    the encryption/decryption of the message at both ends of the communication. When
                                    used correctly, end-to-end encryption offers protection of message content (e.g.,
                                    text messages, voice calls, video calls) in transit.</p>

                                    and technologies for full disk, virtual disk, volume, database, file and folder,
                                    application, and other types of encryption—each with its own benefits and
                                    limitations. In this context, encryption represents a primary technical control for
                                    protection of the information assets, so it must be used when and where it is
                                    required (i.e., by laws and regulations) or justified (i.e., from a business

                                    called a container, which can hold many files and folders, and permitting access to
                                    the data within the container only after proper authentication is provided, at which
                                    point the container is typically mounted as a virtual disk. Virtual disk encryption
                                    is used on all types of end-user device storage. The container is a single file that
                                    resides within a logical volume. Examples of volumes are boot, system, and data
                                    volumes on a personal computer, and a USB flash drive formatted with a single file
                                    system. Volume encryption is the process of encrypting an entire logical volume and
                                    permitting access to the data on the volume only after proper authentication is
                                    provided. Volume encryption is most often performed on hard drive data volumes and
                                    volume-based removable media, such as USB flash drives and external hard

                                    easily evolve and adopt alternatives to the cryptographic primitives it was
                                    originally designed to use. The X.509 certificate format is an example of
                                    cryptographic agility, supporting various hash algorithms, signature algorithms, key
                                    sizes to address future needs. Cryptographic agility is a common theme during the
                                    architecture and design of cryptographic libraries, APIs, and frameworks, including
                                    those found in .NET and Java. When new vulnerabilities are found or algorithms are
                                    broken, switching to new crypto providers should not put a significant burden on the
                                    software development team. Cryptographic agility could lead to complexities and
                                    potential vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly. This may be considered a
                                    disadvantage.</p>

                                    avoid custom cryptography. Avoid weak algorithms when possible, as they may provide
                                    a false sense of security. Understand that the field is rapidly changing, and when
                                    evaluating algorithm choices, both the algorithm and the key size should be
                                    considered. Remember that Data Encryption Standard (DES), which was once considered
                                    government standard, was broken much more quickly than anticipated due to inadequate
                                    key length, which made a brute force attempt possible. Follow the best practices,
                                    adopting symmetric algorithms, asymmetric algorithms, hash functions, etc. For
                                    example, best practices may recommend the use of SHA 256 or better, which implies
                                    that the use of the MD series of hash functions should be avoided.</p>

                                    to eliminate the uncertainty in enforcing accurate access decisions in information

                                    to software design and implementation. Many object-oriented software development

                                    computers were invented, the discovery of many new vulnerabilities has been
                                    witnessed. Although software seems to possess the lion’s share of
                                    identified/researched vulnerabilities, as evidenced by the frequency and number of
                                    released patches, hardware vulnerabilities should not be forgotten or
                                    underestimated.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Vulnerabilities in hardware may also be exploited to gain access
                                    to sensitive data. Ultimately, all operations on a computer are dependent on
                                    hardware at the lowest levels. Attacks targeting hardware can be divided into two
                                    broad categories: those that intend to exploit hardware features to bypass security
                                    checks of the operating system, and those that attempt to directly exploit the
                                    hardware architecture itself. To understand the gravity of the situation, imagine a
                                    scenario where a process executes itself at ring 0 (most privileged), independent of
                                    the operating system, with no checks and balances, exploiting the architecture to
                                    allocate memory and deploying payloads, all with no supervision or interference of
                                    the OS.</p>

                                <p class="comment78305">In 2017, multiple teams of security researchers independently
                                    discovered a new class of hardware vulnerabilities in a broad set of microprocessors
                                    found in personal computers, servers, tablets, and phones. These vulnerabilities,
                                    which became known as Spectre and Meltdown, took advantage of a performance
                                    optimization technique found in these microprocessors to allow an attacker to bypass
                                    security mechanisms protecting data stored in computer systems. The implications of
                                    this vulnerability were severe: it could allow theft of credentials and
                                    cryptographic keys, or exfiltration of sensitive data. Mitigating the risk of these
                                    vulnerabilities required efforts at multiple levels, including patches in firmware
                                    and microcode, updates to operating systems, and modifications in
                                    applications.<sup>10</sup></p>
