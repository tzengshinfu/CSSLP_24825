                                    categorizations, and mechanisms related to reporting within the context of a secure
                                    software-development life cycle. Reporting occurs at different levels of the
                                    organization from the board of directors down to the system level. Reports and
                                    report information can generally be grouped or categorized making aggregation and
                                    collection more feasible. Reporting mechanisms will trigger report artifact
                                    generation at various stages within the lifecycle. Reporting is only comprehensive
                                    when a security practitioner ensures reporting occurs at the correct time with
                                    actionable information sent to the appropriate stakeholders.</p>

                                    development processes and operational security reporting, which deals more with
                                    various levels of reporting within an organizational structure.</p>

                                <p class="comment78305">There are several ways to define an organizational structure for
                                    reporting and other purposes. As an example, <em>NIST SP 800-39—Managing Information
                                        Security Risk </em>describes a multitiered security reporting structure of three
                                    tiers: organizational, business process, and information systems.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The organizational tier provides the strategy and context for
                                    the entire organization, which includes lower-level reports. This level of the
                                    organization includes stakeholders such as the C-suite and the board of directors,
                                    as reporting must provide information that can be actioned at a high level. It would
                                    be unusual to present a 42-page report listing all high and moderate CVEs for
                                    currently deployed software in the enterprise. Instead, a leader from security might
                                    present the total quantity for high and moderate CVEs, and three potential
                                    approaches for addressing them that include costs.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The next tier down, business process, might be synonymous within
                                    some organizations with a department (e.g., IT department, security operations
                                    center). At this tier, reporting is likely consolidated from each system, software,
                                    or network appliance into dashboards and other visual methods that allow for
                                    situational awareness within the mission or operation of the organization.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">At the lowest tier, we have information systems—end points.
                                    Reporting at this level is detailed and quantitative, with system logs, network
                                    logs, configuration baselines, and CVEs for particular software installed on
                                    hardware within the organization. The following figure demonstrates one possible
                                    structure for the flow of security reporting within an organization.</p>

                                    <li><em>Plan. </em>Opportunities and risks can be captured and recorded within the
                                        risk register. If using Agile then the backlog could provide context for
                                        reporting—for example, do user stories have acceptance criteria that include
                                        security considerations?</li>
                                    <li><em>Code/Build/Test. </em>Some Integrated development environments (IDE) can
                                        provide developers trustworthiness of third-party libraries or linter
                                        suggestions based on language style guides. Often before source code can be
                                        committed to a repository it must pass a gated check-in where unit, integration,
                                        and/or static analysis tests review the source code for defects. If the source
                                        code is found deficient, it is often shelved (i.e., shelveset) instead of
                                        committed into the code base as a changeset. There is often reporting on the
                                        CWEs or style issues and emails sent about failing to commit the change.</li>
                                    <li><em>Release/Deploy/Operate/Monitor. </em>Once the source is branched into an
                                        official release there will likely be a final statement regarding the software
                                        risks and mitigations. The organization or authorizing official will use a
                                        document such as a system authorization package, sometimes referred to as SAP,
                                        to decide whether the software system is authorized to operate. Once software is
                                        deployed and operating, it is monitored. Monitoring and reporting mechanisms are
                                        established at the various tiers of the organization such as in the example
                                        given on organizational security reporting—at the information system level,
                                        business level, and strategic tier.</li>

                                    BSIMM and SAMM, as described earlier in this domain, define maturity levels for
                                    respective security practices. SAMM defines three maturity levels as objectives.
                                    Each level within a security practice is characterized by a successively more
                                    sophisticated objective defined by specific activities, with more stringent success
                                    metrics than the previous level. Additionally, each security practice can be

                                    on creating the opportunity for teams to regularly and frequently reflect on what
                                    was done well, and to identify what can be improved upon. In fact, incorporating
                                    security in this type of environment relies upon these retrospectives that can help

                                <p class="comment78305">The frequency of running these retrospectives is up to the team;
                                    they could be scheduled at the end of each sprint, or less frequently as the
                                    organization sees fit. Regardless of the frequency, for these retrospectives to be
                                    effective, a key requirement is to embrace a positive spirit and open mindset to

                                    quality of the processes used to build software is usually reflected in the quality
                                    of the software product itself. Failure to make improvements to processes despite
                                    the attempt could be due to various reasons, including:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Over-emphasis on assessments and insufficient commitments to making improvements

                                    flowing from one tier of an organization to another and feedback loops integrated
                                    into processes and systems. Feedback loops are integrally important to ensure
                                    stability within development processes.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Continuing the thread on gated check-in: Suppose Jeramie was a
                                    developer at your organization, and he attempted to commit source code that
                                    contained several critical security defects. As a result, the build and test portion
                                    of the pipeline would hopefully reject his changes. This would be good for the
                                    overall status of the branch of software he was attempting to advance with a commit.
                                    However, Jeramie needs to know his changes were not committed. He needs feedback.
                                    Perhaps, the team needs to assist with remediation; in that case, they would require
                                    notification also.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Feedback loops help ensure corrective actions are taken before a
                                    process can progress. In dynamic and automatic systems, output from the system
                                    action is directly input into the system to inform the next action. Feedback can be
                                    positive or negative. When feedback is positive, inputs into a system accelerate or
                                    advance a process. When feedback is negative, inputs back into the system reduce
                                    processing to preserve a stable state— much like the gated check-in slowed Jeramie’s
                                    ability to commit code with defects but with the result being more secure software.
                                    In the most general sense, feedback loops also provide the opportunity for improving
                                    processes in the future.</p>
