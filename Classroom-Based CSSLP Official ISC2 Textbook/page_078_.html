                                    continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) planning is a requirement by various
                                    regulations and standards and a significant part of many information security

                                    drive adopted strategies for backup and recovery. DR strategies must meet an

                                    operations is the key driver for continuity planning. Organizations may have
                                    separate business continuity (BC) and DR plans or may have a BCDR plan that
                                    addresses both.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Information systems are vulnerable to a variety of disruptions,
                                    ranging from mild (e.g., short-term power outage, disk drive failure) to severe
                                    (e.g., equipment destruction, fire). Much vulnerability may be minimized or
                                    eliminated through management, operational, or technical controls as part of the
                                    organization’s resiliency effort; however, it is virtually impossible to eliminate
                                    all risks.<sup>30</sup></p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Governance must be addressed first. Policy and procedures must
                                    be established, and a business continuity plan (BCP) developed. The BCP focuses on
                                    sustaining an organization’s mission/business processes during and after a
                                    disruption. An example of a mission/business process may be an organization’s
                                    payroll process or customer service process. A BCP may be written for
                                    mission/business processes within a single business unit or may address the entire
                                    organization’s processes. The BCP may also be scoped to address only the functions
                                    deemed to be priorities. Because mission/business processes use information systems
                                    (ISs), the BC planner must coordinate with information system owners to ensure that
                                    the BCP expectations and IS capabilities are matched. A Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
                                    applies to major, usually physical disruptions to service that deny access to the
                                    primary facility infrastructure for an extended period. A DRP is an information
                                    system-focused plan designed to restore operability of the target system,
                                    application, or computer facility infrastructure at an alternate site after an
                                    emergency.<sup>31</sup></p>

                                    Incremental, and Differential.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Full. </em>A full backup captures all files on the disk or within the folder
                                        selected for backup. Because all backed-up files are recorded to a single media
                                        or media set, locating a particular file or group of files is simple. However,
                                        the time required to perform a full backup can be lengthy. In addition,
                                        maintaining multiple iterations of full backups of files that do not change
                                        frequently (such as system files) could lead to excessive, unnecessary media
                                        storage requirements.</li>
                                    <li><em>Incremental. </em>An incremental backup captures files created or changed
                                        since the last backup, regardless of backup type. Incremental backups afford
                                        more efficient use of storage media, and backup times are reduced. However, to
                                        recover a system from an incremental backup, media from different backup
                                        operations may be required. For example, consider a case in which a directory
                                        needs to be recovered. If the last full backup was performed three days prior
                                        and one file had changed each day, then the media for the full backup and for
                                        each day’s incremental backups would be needed to restore the entire directory.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><em>Differential. </em>A differential backup stores files created or modified
                                        since the last full backup. Therefore, if a file is changed after the previous
                                        full backup, a differential backup will save the file each time until the next
                                        full backup is completed. A differential backup takes less time to complete than
                                        a full backup. Restoring from a differential backup may require fewer media than
                                        an incremental backup because only the full backup media and the last
                                        differential media would be needed. As a disadvantage, differential backups take
                                        longer to complete than incremental backups because the amount of data since the
                                        last full backup increases each day until the next full backup is
                                        executed.<sup>34</sup></li>

                                    to cloud-enabled platforms. Cloud backup is a common backup technology. Cloud
                                    service providers and customers have unique responsibilities. In a cloud computing
                                    environment, backup and restoration responsibilities vary based on their cloud
                                    service model: Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and
                                    Platform as a Service (PaaS). For SaaS, the cloud service provider bears essentially
                                    all backup and restoration responsibilities. For IaaS, the customer has total
                                    responsibility. For PaaS, there is a split, where generally the customer is
                                    responsible for application- and data-related activities and the cloud service
                                    provider (CSP) has responsibility for OS-related duties. Configuration data for
                                    hosts in the cloud environment should also be part of the backup plan.</p>

                                    proper functioning of the backup system should be conducted as part of the DR plan.

                                    retained for periods of time likely to satisfy operational needs of the organization
                                    or to meet compliance requirements. Cost and availability considerations can affect
                                    data access procedures. Continually changing technologies can also have a major
                                    impact on desired archiving formats. Archived data must continue to be protected in
                                    compliance with organizational policies and regulatory requirements.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Media selection may be an important consideration depending on
                                    archiving requirements and strategies used. Tapes may have limited life and prove to
                                    be difficult to search, but they may be appropriate for specific situations. Optical
                                    forms of storage such as DVDs may offer some advantages but be insufficient to meet
                                    other requirements.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Keep in mind that depending on the requirements (e.g., retention
                                    and searchability of the archives), data archiving solutions offered through leading
                                    cloud service providers may prove to be advantageous.</p>

                                    that data backups are designed for the rapid recovery of operational data, while

                                    Backups are performed to preserve business continuity, and archiving is relied upon

                                    to the BC initiatives of the organization, and concerns formulating a plan for the
                                    recovery of IT systems and services from disruptive events. Organizations should
                                    establish and maintain a disaster recovery plan (DRP) aligned with their mission and
                                    service delivery requirements.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">DR should not focus on the recovery of every IT function,
                                    system, or service, but rather on the mission-critical ones. It should also ensure
                                    that the recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs) of the
                                    business (or lines of business) can be achieved through the adopted strategies.
                                    Business impact analysis can be used for the purpose of establishing these
                                    objectives.</p>

                                    consideration during DR planning, as replication of assets (e.g., databases) across
                                    multiple locations must be assumed. The disaster recovery site is likely to be
                                    geographically remote from any primary sites. The relevant locations to be
                                    considered depend on the geographic scale of the calamity anticipated. This is
                                    particularly important since DR in the cloud has gained widespread acceptance.</p>

                                    momentum. Cloud resiliency represents the ability of a cloud services data center
                                    and its associated components (e.g., servers, storage) to continue operating in the
                                    event of a disruption, whether caused by equipment failure, power outage, or a
                                    natural disaster. Given that most cloud providers have a significantly greater
                                    number of devices and redundancies in place than a standard in-house IT team, cloud
                                    resiliency should typically be far higher, offering equipment and capabilities ready
                                    to failover, multiple layers of redundancy, and enhanced exercises to test such

                                    concept of cyber resiliency interchangeably, but there are subtle differences. For
                                    instance, cyber resiliency, survivability, and redundancy are closely related. As
                                    described earlier, cyber resiliency a system’s ability to withstand compromises to
                                    confidentiality, integrity, and availability. If it is difficult to degrade a system
                                    or multiple vectors of attack are the only method of compromise, security
                                    practitioners might reference the system as being resilient.</p>

                                    to minimize the impact of a finite-duration disturbance by reducing the likelihood
                                    or magnitude of a disturbance. Suppose several clustered, geographically distributed
                                    servers were used to host a high-availability web application in Turkey. One of the
                                    data centers in Trabzon flooded and all that location’s technical infrastructure was
                                    destroyed. The impact of this natural event on the web application is only slightly
                                    higher latency for users that still falls within business objectives. The web
                                    application is still available. The clustered and distributed server architecture in
                                    this scenario provides survivability by limiting the disruption to slightly higher
                                    latency. The architecture also makes complete denial of service highly unlikely. For
                                    this reason, the web application seems to have good survivability due to redundant
                                    servers. Due to infrastructure redundancies, the system has good survivability
                                    against natural disasters and other threat actors which might create a DoS for the
                                    web application. If all major threats are accounted for and the system can withstand
                                    most threats, then we would consider the web application cyber resilient.</p>

                                    storage applications will often use the data dispersion technique. For this
                                    technique, each storage block is fragmented, and the storage application writes each
                                    bit into different physical storage containers to achieve greater information
                                    assurance. This resembles the traditional RAID system, except that the applications
                                    are scattered across different physical devices.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The underlying architecture of this technology is based on
                                    erasure coding, which chunks a data object (like a file with self-describing
                                    metadata) into segments. Each segment is encrypted, cut into 16 slices, and
                                    dispersed across an organization’s network to reside on different hard drives and
                                    servers. If the organization has access to only 10 of the slices—because of disk
                                    failures, for instance—the original data can still be put back together. If the data
                                    is generally static with few rewrites, such as media files and archive logs,
                                    creating and distributing the data is a one-time cost. If the data is dynamic, the
                                    erasure codes must be recreated, and the resulting data blocks redistributed.</p>
