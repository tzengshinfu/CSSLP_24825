                                    communication protocols. The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
                                    (TCP/IP) stack contains many insecure protocols at various layers, such as File
                                    Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Telnet; you should avoid using these protocols to
                                    transmit sensitive content. Instead, alternatives such as Secure Shell (SSH) file
                                    transfer or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) should be used.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Alternatives to insecure protocols should at minimum provide a
                                    confidentiality mechanism for otherwise plaintext transmission—that is, a way to
                                    encrypt data being transmitted—and a method of authenticating clients and servers.
                                    An example of protocols intended for secure remote access is IPsec, which is the
                                    name for a suite of protocols that rely on public-key technology for securing
                                    communication.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The leading general purpose secure web communication protocol is
                                    the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, based on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
                                    TLS is widely used to provide secure channels for confidential TCP/IP communication
                                    on the web.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Always follow best practices regarding the usage of protocols:

                                    separate roles and permissions, sharing organizational infrastructure such as a
                                    computer or network printer. Confidentiality issues may arise on shared computer
                                    systems when a user with higher privileges accesses organizational data, such as
                                    source code stored in a repository, and stores a local copy using software such as
                                    Git. If the local storage is accessible by any user, then the next user to access
                                    the machine will have undue access to the organization's intellectual property. The
                                    same issue can arise from organizational printers storing recent print media in
                                    memory that is accessible for reprint by anyone with physical access to the device.

                                    users to share files that are housed on their individual computers. Peer-to-peer
                                    (P2P) applications, such as those used to share music files, are some of the most
                                    common forms of file-sharing technology. However, P2P applications introduce

                                    file-sharing across the internet. All solutions should seek to maintain
                                    organizationally defined confidentiality and integrity of files from the entire path
                                    between sender and receiver. Below is a summary of NIST general guidance for
                                    securing file exchanges:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Organizations should identify user data access requirements. to exchange files.
                                        Needs should include defining senders, receivers, and sensitivity of the data.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>After defining needs, organizations should provide training and solutions to

                                <p class="comment78305">A code repository is a file-based storage structure for software
                                    source code and metadata pertaining to that code. The structure can be centralized
                                    (e.g., a file archive on a local server) or distributed (e.g., on a web-based
                                    repository). A key element of a code repository is that it enforces both access
                                    control and version control. The access control is typically either role based or by
                                    individual identification. In both cases, the three core principles of
                                    confidentiality, integrity, and nonrepudiation with respect to the source code need
                                    to be enforced.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The specific operations will be derived from the code repository
                                    requirements, as will the level of access control to be performed. The type of
                                    access control may depend on the capabilities of the code repository:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Will it support project-level roles?</li>
                                    <li>Is there a default or preferred version-control system?</li>
                                    <li>Does it support local and remote user bases?</li>
                                    <li>Does it include integrated development environment support?</li>
                                    <li>Is there support for authentication systems, such as OpenID or SSH keys?</li>
                                    <li>Does it support additional security plug-ins and tools?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="comment78305">The code repository must be sufficiently secured to address the
                                    risk of unauthorized access and modification of the code base by malicious subjects,

                                <p class="comment78305">Historically, the term “build” has been used to refer to
                                    compiling the source code into binary code, assembling, and packaging the software
                                    and its various dependencies, and preparing it for release and deployment. </p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Realistically, the “build process” may be complex and involve
                                    various tools and technologies depending on the nature of the software. A consistent
                                    build requires the proper build environment, comprising the right structure and
                                    elements. It must include not only the source-code repositories, compilers, and
                                    linkers, but also libraries, configuration files, build-automation scripts, and test
                                    suites.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Given the advancements in tools and technologies, some tools may
                                    be a collection of tools that provide a large array of functionality and facilitate
                                    compilation from within developers’ integrated development environments (IDEs).</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Most organizations that engage in software development have
                                    development, test, and production environments, so build deliverables go through
                                    development and QA before they enter production. Organizations must ensure security
                                    and integrity of each environment.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Although it is true that it’s more efficient to automate
                                    functions such as building code, running tests, and deployment, the build and
                                    deployment tooling should also include security considerations for risks (e.g., risk
                                    of compromise in code integrity) that are relevant at this stage.</p>

                                    </em>article, “Protecting Software Integrity Through Code Signing,” “An effective
                                    and common method of protecting software is to apply a digital signature to the
                                    code. When securely implemented, digitally signing code provides both data integrity
                                    to prove that the code was not modified, and source authentication to identify who
                                    was in control of the code at the time it was signed. Verifying the signature
                                    assures the recipient that the code came from the source that signed it, and that it
                                    has not been modified in transit.”<sup>11</sup></p>

                                    must be noted that code signing provides assurance that the software is authentic
                                    and has not been tampered with during the distribution and maintenance phases, and
                                    the verifier can validate these properties at runtime.</p>
