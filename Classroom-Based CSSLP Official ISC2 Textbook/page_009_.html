                                    change when requirements are not well established at the project’s initiation, and
                                    some focus on security. This section will focus on the security considerations for

                                    of the overall application. In theory, all activities in a precursor phase must be
                                    completed before proceeding to the next phase. Generally, this implies infrequent
                                    release cycles with lengthy phases. Decades ago, Waterfall was used to successfully
                                    develop software projects, but it is not best suited for rapid development where
                                    requirement changes occur frequently. Today, Waterfall has largely been replaced
                                    with <strong><button

                                    be covered later. However, Waterfall is still embraced within some organizations due
                                    to contractual constraints or organizational culture, so it is important for
                                    security-focused individuals to understand Waterfall.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">For the security practitioner, Waterfall offers a
                                    straightforward methodology with well-defined project phases to integrate security
                                    considerations. Since the software project will be well defined at the beginning it
                                    is important that security is considered at project initiation. For an internal
                                    software project within an organization, this might be as simple as including
                                    cybersecurity professionals as stakeholders when drafting the project charter and
                                    requirements. For external software projects, clear and testable security
                                    requirements should be incorporated into contractual language. Further, security
                                    considerations can also be integrated into each gate or phase of the software
                                    project beyond the Requirements phase.</p>

                                    approach relies on short iterations where the project is deconstructed into small
                                    components that may be started and completed during short development iterations.
                                    The incremental nature of adaptive planning and execution provides the ability to
                                    remain flexible as project requirements and scope evolve throughout the SDLC.</p>

                                    updating existing functionality. When a sprint ends, any tasks marked done are

                                        related to security concerns are clearly marked to ensure that security concerns
                                        will be addressed in the sprint that addresses the user story. Risk analysis of
                                        each user story is performed to quantify potential losses resulting from
                                        software compromises in monetary terms. Secure Scrum permits third-party
                                        security experts to be involved in planning (for training of the Scrum team and
                                        identifying security concerns), and during sprints (to provide turnkey solutions
                                        to security issues). Scrum Masters object to the inclusion of outsiders on a
                                        Scrum team, insisting that security must be addressed by the Scrum team itself
                                        as a part of normal unit testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery,
                                        and the SDLC’s other compact, continuous feedback loops. They also insist that
                                        any security tools must be understandable by developers and must support how
                                        they already work and think.</li>

                                        within the context of a sprint iteration.</li>

                                <p class="comment78305">Development Operations (DevOps) is often described as a logical
                                    extension of Agile, pioneered by lean-thinking organizations seeking solutions for
                                    rapid and frequent delivery of software. Many modern organizations have adopted
                                    DevOps for a variety of reasons—most notably because businesses need to build, test,
                                    and release software faster and more reliably to stay competitive. Much like Agile
                                    implements’ shorter development iterations, DevOps has the goal of shortening the
                                    SDLC while improving the reliability of incremental source changes such as feature
                                    enhancements, bug fixes, and updates.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Technological aspects of DevOps are primarily about continuous
                                    integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices, relying on the automation of much
                                    of the routine work of transforming code changes into verified production software.
                                    Several tools and technologies have been introduced for this specific purpose, but
                                    successful implementation of DevOps requires special attention to—and organizational
                                    investment in—people and processes in addition to technology.</p>

                                    but adds an additional focus on software assurance. DevSecOps bridges the gap
                                    between security and DevOps. Security should ultimately remain focused on minimizing
                                    enterprise risk, and at the same time allow development to deliver more secure code
                                    at the rate dictated by business needs. This implies that traditional
                                    resource-intensive and heavyweight security activities throughout the
                                    software-development life cycle must also change from being prescribed by nature to
                                    adaptive. As depicted in the figure, security must be injected into the existing
                                    development workflow in DevOps life cycle.</p>

                                    Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). Secure practitioners need to
                                    understand the difference between security operations for software development teams
                                    and producing security-hardened software and the CIA considerations for both when
                                    managing software security. One way to illustrate the difference, is to discuss each
                                    within the context of DevSecOps.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Operational security considerations exist for development teams
                                    producing software using the DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline. The source code repository
                                    and integrated development environment (IDE) used should ensure that the software
                                    source is available during the sprint, only accessible by development when being
                                    stored in the repository (confidential), and that no developer can deploy production
                                    changes without leveraging the quality and security checks built into the pipeline
                                    (integrity). This is an oversimplified example that illustrates Security Operations
                                    within the SDLC. Note that all the mentioned operational security does not directly
                                    relate to the end software product being more secure.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">In addition to Security Operations, we also need to conduct
                                    software hardening through software assurance processes to make organizational
                                    software secure and resilient. Software hardening focuses on producing software
                                    capable of satisfying the organizations defined levels of CIA for the end software
                                    product. These efforts might include static analysis—analysing uncompiled source
                                    code to find CWEs. It might also include dynamic analysis—analysing the compiled
                                    source within a runtime environment to find vulnerabilities such as buffer
                                    overflows.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">As security practitioners, independent of methodology, we must
                                    ensure that the process for developing software is secure from an operational
                                    perspective while delivering software that functions as intended and is free of
                                    vulnerabilities, either intentionally or unintentionally designed or inserted as
