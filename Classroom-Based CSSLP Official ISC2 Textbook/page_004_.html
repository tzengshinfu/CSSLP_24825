                                    decisions at the system and software architecture level. It is important for
                                    security practitioners to understand architecture and design principles are
                                    abstracted away from platform and programming language specifics. These principles
                                    lay the foundation for building and maintaining secure software.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Decisions are made to establish <em>adequate security,
                                    </em>which represents intentional trade-offs to reach a state of security that
                                    supports the business function of the system or software. Sometimes one principle is
                                    given more consideration than another based on how the organization defines the
                                    system as reasonably secure. According to NIST, secure systems typically exhibit the

                                <p class="comment78305">Least privilege is the concept of providing no more
                                    authorizations than necessary to perform the required functions. This also implies
                                    that if an operation requires elevated privileges, such privilege elevation should
                                    be limited to the shortest time required to complete that operation.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">The principle of least privilege states that each component
                                    should be allocated sufficient privileges to accomplish its specified functions, but
                                    no more. This limits the scope of the component’s actions, which has two desirable
                                    effects: the security impact of a failure, corruption, or misuse of the component
                                    will have a minimized security impact; and the security analysis of the component
                                    will be simplified. Least privilege is a pervasive principle that is reflected in
                                    all aspects of the secure system design.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">For example, if a middleware server only requires access to the
                                    network, read access to a database table, and the ability to write to a log, this
                                    describes all the permissions that should be granted. Under no circumstances should
                                    the middleware be granted administrative privileges.<sup>2</sup></p>

                                    run time can lead to the magnification of inflicted harm if a software vulnerability
                                    is discovered and exploited. A real-life example would be how excessive app
                                    permissions at run time can cause many different issues related to security and
                                    privacy.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">A classic example would be when the input validation mechanisms
                                    in software fail to prevent SQL injection attacks (i.e., due to ineffective regular
                                    expressions) and the vulnerability is successfully exploited. When this occurs,
                                    elevated privileges may lead to significantly more harmful payloads such as wiping
                                    out one’s data.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Another example is the early-release flashlight apps that were
                                    downloaded from app stores for smartphones and other mobile devices. These apps
                                    require access to one’s location data and the contacts on the mobile device. Of
                                    course, most security-conscious users were concerned with these required app
                                    permissions and the contents/resources that were accessed by these types of apps,
                                    but the apps were nevertheless installed and used. A clear message that should be
                                    conveyed is that addressing the least privilege principle is critical, but doing so
                                    may be a complex process and require considerable effort.</p>

                                    implementation typically includes three components: a policy engine, a policy
                                    administrator, and a policy enforcement point. The policy engine coordinates with
                                    the policy administrator component to action and log the approve-deny decisions
                                    originating from the policy administrator. The policy administrator brokers an
                                    access path from the policy enforcement point. This communication is often referred
                                    to in the context of a “control plane.” The policy enforcement point is responsible
                                    for initiating, terminating, and monitoring connections using a client-server access
                                    model. Simply put, security practitioners should understand that zero trust is a
                                    high-level strategy that once implemented should enforce the same level of mutual

                                    critical functions must be divided among subjects to mitigate the risk of fraud.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">For example, an administrator should be able to turn the system
                                    on or off, and set password policy, but shouldn’t be able to log on to the

                                <p class="comment78305">Applying proper separation of duties clearly requires
                                    subjects/actors performing the separated duties to be different entities, but there
                                    may be different levels of segregation involved. At the most basic level, the
                                    segregation may involve two different actors that are performing similar functions
                                    and duties (e.g., two actors from the same department). Taking this to the next
                                    level, segregation could involve different actors that perform dissimilar

                                    creation of effective layered defenses in all these realms requires a clear
                                    understanding of how various controls or pieces of technology can fit together. In
                                    theory, a system may have any number of security zones, and each zone may have any
                                    number of controls. How many zones and what controls are needed will depend on
                                    several factors, including the type of assets in each zone and the level of

                                    highlighted the importance of controls positioned at various layers of defense. Also
                                    important is the assurance that these controls are diverse in their capabilities, as
                                    each may play a specific role in the overall defenses of the system. Further,
                                    diversity also reduces the likelihood that a common flaw or vulnerability would be
                                    exhibited by all such controls.</p>

                                    disrupting system operations. If a project is large and critical, an organization
                                    might ensure that any systems and software being supplied are from multiple vendors
                                    or leverage multiple technologies.</p>

                                    reason. To be resilient, software needs to fail in a safe/secure manner. One
                                    requirement is that when a system fails, it should fail to a state where the
                                    security of the system and its data are not compromised.</p>

                                    software security, fail secure is commonly used interchangeably with fail safe,

                                    failure are undesirable in any system with a goal of availability. Eliminating

                                    enhance security as opposed to relatively straightforward and simple approaches.
                                    This also implies that the more complex the design of a system/software, the higher
                                    the likelihood that a given vulnerability may go unnoticed.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">This concept of simplicity is echoed by the principle of Build
                                    Security In (BSI): One factor in evaluating a system's security is its complexity.
                                    If the design, implementation, or security mechanisms are highly complex, then the
                                    likelihood of security vulnerabilities increases. Subtle problems in complex systems
                                    may be difficult to find, especially in copious amounts of code. For instance,
                                    analyzing the source code that is responsible for the normal execution of a

                                    on underlying hardware resources such as storage mediums, CPUs, and RAM which must
                                    be allocated appropriately when developing source code. Further, applications must
                                    efficiently free—that is, deallocate—resources when execution of a task has
                                    completed. When resources are not managed properly due to poor coding practices, the
                                    implications extend beyond inefficiently run software. Poorly implemented and
                                    designed software can deprive other software running on the same resources (e.g.,
                                    server, hypervisor) of necessary resources, causing a negative impact on operations
                                    that extends the scope beyond the poorly implemented software.</p>

                                    request by a subject for accessing an object (especially for security-critical
                                    objects) must be vetted. That is, it should undergo a valid and effective
                                    authorization procedure. A system that relies on checking the permissions of a
                                    subject to an object only once can potentially invite attackers to exploit that
                                    system. Caching permissions can increase the performance of a system, but at the
                                    cost of allowing secured objects to be accessed.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">For example, when a UNIX process tries to read a file, the
                                    operating system determines whether the process is allowed to read the file. If so,
                                    the process receives a file descriptor encoding the allowed access. Whenever the
                                    process wants to read the file, it presents the file descriptor to the kernel. The
                                    kernel then allows access. If the owner of the file disallows the process permission
                                    to read the file after the file descriptor is issued, the kernel still allows
                                    access. This scheme violates the principle of complete mediation, because the second
                                    access is not checked. The cached value is used, resulting in the denial of access
                                    being ineffective.</p>

                                    system should not be dependent on secrecy of its design, its implementation, or its
                                    components. As an example, publishing an encryption algorithm for review by experts
                                    can in fact result in the identification of weaknesses in the algorithm which in
                                    turn results in increased security.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">In this regard, noting that security through obscurity alone may
                                    not be achieved, Kerckhoff's principle suggests that so long as secrecy of the
                                    encryption key is maintained, the security of a cryptographic system should also be
                                    maintained, even if everything about the system is public knowledge. Basing security
                                    on open standards could potentially increase portability and interoperability as

                                    example, serving an application on the Internet allows both attackers and users to
                                    gain access to the application. Sensitive information can potentially be shared
                                    between the subjects via the mechanism. A different mechanism (or instantiation of a
                                    mechanism) for each subject or class of subjects can provide flexibility of access
                                    control among various users and prevent potential security violations that would
                                    otherwise occur if only one mechanism was implemented.</p>

                                <p class="comment78305">Today, there are several methods that authenticate users. For
                                    decades, passwords (something you know) have been the dominant authentication
                                    method. Over time, new factors of authentication have been developed and leveraged
                                    in addition to passwords that create multifactor authentication. However, it is
                                    entirely possible to provide comparable security with more convenience by
                                    authenticating using one or more factors that do not include passwords. Users can
                                    authenticate using access to applications such as email, devices such as phones,
                                    one-time pass codes, or biometrics. Passwordless multifactor is possible by
                                    implementing combinations of something you have and something you are, for example.

                                    Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) during authentication.
                                    CAPTCHA tests require the user to type letters or digits from a distorted image, or
                                    to click on all images in an array that fit a certain description (e.g., all images
                                    that contain traffic lights). CAPTCHA challenges can take a variety of different
                                    shapes and forms.</p>
