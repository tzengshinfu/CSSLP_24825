                                <p class="comment78305">Software supply chains have the potential to include many
                                    linkages, with nuisances such as contract language and licensing terms at each
                                    integration point. GOTS, COTS, and OSS all have the potential to have supply chain
                                    vulnerabilities based on library and service dependencies. Market conditions have
                                    created a heavy reliance on third-party code, including outsourced development
                                    activities. The risk of exploitable vulnerabilities and embedded malicious code in
                                    software must be mitigated. Gaining access to assurance artifacts can be a
                                    non-trivial effort.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">OWASP’s SCVS and SBOM can aid in identifying and reducing risk
                                    in a software supply chain. Safeguarding internal code repositories, including the
                                    development environment, is essential to reducing risk. Public repository security
                                    must also be vetted with a focus on genesis, contributor base, and change process.
                                    Code signing provides assurance that the software is authentic and has not been
                                    tampered with during the distribution and maintenance phases, and the verifier can
                                    validate these properties at runtime.</p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Suppliers must be categorized and evaluated based on their
                                    criticality to the organization's mission. Building a level of confidence in the
                                    security of acquired software may require an audit of the third party’s secure SDLC
                                    policy and practices. Further, intellectual property, code escrow, liability and
                                    warranty, and service-level agreements must be addressed when acquiring software.
                                    Vulnerability and incident notification and reporting, maintenance and support
                                    structure, licensing, and vendors' security track record are considerations during
                                    acquisitions. </p>
                                <p class="comment78305">Mitigating risk early in the life cycle is always a security
                                    prerogative. It is better to establish responsibilities and assurances upfront
                                    contractually, which fosters supply chain trust rather than resorting to periodic
                                    organizationally defined audits and scans as a bolt-on process after adopting a
                                    software supplier. </p>
